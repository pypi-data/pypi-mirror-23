Description: This is a Python wrapper to the low-level API of CQP which allows
        you to access CQP corpora in the same way as Perl's CWB::CL
        
        If you installed CQP in a non-standard location (which is the default for
        newer versions of CQP), point the setup in the right direction with, e.g.
         export CWB_DIR=/usr/local/cwb-3.4.10
        
        To install the module, use the standard
         python setup.py build
         sudo python setup.py install
        command sequence.
        
        As a prerequisite, install Cython with
         pip install Cython
        
        If you use an old version of CQP (CWB 2.99 and older), you need to
        change the value of the "extra_libs" variable in setup.py.
        
        To give you an idea how to use the library, see the following sample:
        
        --- 8< ---
        from CWB.CL import Corpus
        
        # open the corpus
        corpus=Corpus('TUEPP')
        # get sentences and words
        sentences=corpus.attribute('s','s')
        words=corpus.attribute('word','p')
        postags=corpus.attribute('pos','p')
        # retrieve offsets of the 1235th sentence (0-based)
        s_1234=sentences[1234]
        
        for w,p in zip(words[s_1234[0]:s_1234[1]+1],postags[s_1234[0]:s_1234[1]+1]):
            print "%s/%s"%(w,p)
        
        --- 8< ---
        
        In order to test the CWB.CL module's correct installation
        independently of any CQP corpora, you can do a
         python -m doctest tests/idlist.txt
        which should terminate with no output when everything is well.
