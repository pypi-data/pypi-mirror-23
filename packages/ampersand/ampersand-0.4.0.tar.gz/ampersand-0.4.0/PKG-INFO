Description: # Ampersand
        
        The really, *really* minimalistic static site generator.
        
        Ampersand is a minimal static site generator designed to help you manage
        multiple translations of a website without needing to do so dynamically. On its
        own, Ampersand is a command line utility that allows you to separate the text
        content of your website from the markup and store it in a JSON file where you
        can rebuild your page via Mustache templates.
        
        Traditionally, managing translations of a website statically would look
        something like this:
        
        ```
        __ root
        |
        |__ scripts
        |  |__ scripts.js
        |
        |__ styles
        |  |__ styles.css
        |
        |__ lang
            |__ en
            |  |__ index.html
            |  |__ about.html
            |  |__ ...
            |
            |__ fr
                |__ index.html
                |__ about.html
                |__ ...
        ```
        
        In this project, we have a website with two or more English pages that we
        also translated into French. This works, but what happens when I want to make
        some changes to `index.html`? In the past, it was as easy as making my changes
        and saving. Now, I need to copy those changes over to the `fr` folder and
        adapt.
        
        It gets worse the more languages you add.
        
        ## How is Ampersand the solution?
        
        Ampersand lets you create one HTML file that acts as a template and a series
        of JSON files containing the translated phrases. With this, you can then compile
        it into as many languages as you want.
        
        Now, you can leave the translation to the globalization team and focus on
        your code.
        
        ## Philosophy
        
        So as you can tell, Ampersand is a pretty straightforward static site generator.
        Some may even argue that it doesn't do much. This is because Ampersand is a
        *minimalistic* static site generator. But of course, all static site generators
        mention minimalism in their mission statement so saying it here doesn't mean
        much. Never the less, Ampersand aims to do what it's supposed to do without
        jumping through too many hoops that don't help it achieve its goal.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Setting up Ampersand is fairly simple if you have `pip`. For those of you who
        don't, [python.org](https://packaging.python.org/installing/) has it
        documented.
        
        ```
        $ pip install ampersand
        ```
        
        For a bleeding edge and developer version, you can clone the repository:
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/natejms/ampersand.git
        $ cd ampersand
        $ pip install .
        ```
