        <description>
            Filter incoming messages based on the value of the :class:`.ElapsedTimeOption` in the request. At least one
            time limit must be provided.

            This filter can be used as a very simple mechanism for DHCPv6 server fail-over. You can configure one server
            without an elapsed-time filter and another server with a filter that ignores solicit messages when the
            elapsed time is less than a certain value. The first server will try to answer all request, but if it
            doesn't answer all requests for some reason then the client's elapsed time will increase until it passes the
            threshold of the second server, which will then stop ignoring it and respond.
