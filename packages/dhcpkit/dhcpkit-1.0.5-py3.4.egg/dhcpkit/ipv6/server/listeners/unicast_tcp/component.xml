            This listener listens for TCP connections on the unicast address specified as the name of the section. This
            is for BulkLeasequery support, but as an extension the server will also answer other types of messages.

                TCP connections are not used for normal operations. They are used by Leasequery clients and other
                trusted clients for management purposes. Therefore you can specify from which clients to accept
                connections.

                Not specifying any trusted clients will allow connections from everywhere. This is strongly not
                recommended.

                Also note that this only limits which clients may set up a TCP connection to this server. The leasequery
                section contains a list of clients which are allowed to use the leasequery protocol. Clients that are
                allowed to connect over TCP should probably also be allowed to perform leasequeries.
