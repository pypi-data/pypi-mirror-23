            Configuration sections that define Leasequery stores. Each leasequery section must configure exactly one
            store. Stores perform the storing of lease data at the end of a DHCPv6 request. They also handle the queries
            from Leasequery clients to search in that stored data.

            This leasequery store will store observed leases seen in DHCPv6 reply messages in the SQLite database whose

                Leasequeries are not used for normal operations. They can disclose information about clients on your
                network. Therefore you can specify from which clients to accept leasequeries.

                Not specifying any trusted clients will allow leasequeries from everywhere. This is strongly not
                recommended.

                Also note that this only limits which clients may use the leasequery protocol. Clients that are
                performing bulk leasequeries also need to set up a TCP connection to this server. This has to be
                explicitly allowed in the :ref:`listen-tcp` listener.

                DHCPv6 servers SHOULD be configurable with a list of "sensitive options" that must not be returned to
                the requestor when specified in the OPTION_ORO of the OPTION_LQ_QUERY option in the LEASEQUERY message.
                Any option on this list MUST NOT be returned to a requestor, even if requested by that requestor.
