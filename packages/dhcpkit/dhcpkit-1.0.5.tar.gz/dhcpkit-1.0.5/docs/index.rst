DHCPKit
=======

This package contains a flexible DHCPv6 server written in Python 3.4+. Its purpose is to provide a framework for DHCP
services. It was written for ISPs to use in provisioning their customers according to their own business rules. It can
be integrated into existing ISP management and provisioning tools. Writing extensions to DHCPKit is very easy!
