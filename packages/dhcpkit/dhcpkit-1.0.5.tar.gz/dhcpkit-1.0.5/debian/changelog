dhcpkit (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Provide RPM repositories at https://repo.dhcpkit.org/
  * Add PD-Exclude option implementation
  * Add Client FQDN option implementation
  * Add Timezone options implementation
  * Add Relay Echo-Request option implementation
  * Add Relay Echo-Request option handler implementation
  * Fixed Python type annotations in many places
  * Show LDRA relays when printing :class:`.TransactionBundle`
  * The DHCPv6 server will try to keep going when not running as root, it might sometimes work, for example when
    connecting to a VPP instance instead of the usual opening listening sockets on low ports
  * Improve DNS handling: be explicit about difference between absolute and relative domain names
  * New :class:`.UnknownProtocolElement` available for more generic protocol parsing
  * :data:`.All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers` and :data:`.All_DHCP_Servers` are now instances of IPv6Address instead
    of strings
  * Added an :class:`.IgnoreMessage` exception type so listeners can signal to the server that the received data is to
    be ignored
  * The :class:`.IncompleteMessage` exception is now a subclass of :class:`.IgnoreMessage`

dhcpkit (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix leasequery statistics output, also fixes Observium stats
  * Add rate limit handler to ignore obnoxious clients
  * Add implementation for the Leasequery and Bulk Leasequery protocols
  * Ignore MAC address `00:00:00:00:00:00` when searching for a server-id
  * Fix finding the inner relay message in a RelayForwardMessage
  * Improve logging for ignored messages
  * The default log level now only logs errors, not warnings
  * Improve exception handling and logging for errors during worker
    initialisation
  * Sending replies has been moved from the main process to the worker
    processes
  * Therefore :class:`.OutgoingPacketBundle` does no longer exist
  * Constants for status codes have been renamed to be more consistent, the
    old names have been deprecated and will be removed in the future
  * Tests have been moved under the dhcpkit module to be easier to import
    from other extensions (for example when they need a solicit message and
    packet to test with)
  * Added Leasequery and Bulk Leasequery messages, options and status codes
  * Leasequery needs RelayForwardMessages without a contained message, so
    allow that now
  * Code for privilege management have been moved to dhcpkit.common
  * Code for console logging has been moved to dhcpkit.common.logging
  * Replies are now sent directly from worker processes, not first handed
    back to the master and then sent from there
  * Refactor listeners and message handling to allow for TCP listeners and
    leasequery extensions
  * Open sockets with SO_REUSEADDR so we can restart quickly without having
    to wait for TIME_WAIT
  * Allow for multiple responses in transaction bundle, especially useful
    for TCP connections
