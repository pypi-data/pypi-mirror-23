Description: tidyextractors
        =================
        
        Overview
        -----------------
        
        ``tidyextractors`` makes extracting data from supported sources as painless as possible, delivering you a populated Pandas DataFrame in three lines of code. ``tidyextractors`` was inspired by `Hadley Wickham's (2014) paper <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>`_  which introduces "tidy data" as a conceptual framework for data preparation.
