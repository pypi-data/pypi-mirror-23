Description: ## octoDNS DDNS
        
        A simple Dynamic DNS source for [octoDNS](https://github.com/github/octodns/).
        
        Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Generally useful when you have a zone
        with staticly configured records but would also like to include a dynamic
        record, e.g. for your office or home on a non-fixed IP address.
        
        By default it uses http://api.ident.me/ to find the public address of the
        machine running the sync.
        
        ### Example config
        
        The following config will combine the records in `./config/example.com.yaml`
        and the dynamically looked up address at `dynamic.example.com.` creating both
        IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
        
        ```yaml
        providers:
        
          config:
            class: octodns.provider.yaml.YamlProvider
            directory: ./config
        
          dynamic:
            class: octodns_ddns.DdnsSource
        
          route53:
            class: octodns.provider.route53.Route53Provider
            access_key_id: env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            secret_access_key: env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        
        zones:
        
          example.com.:
            sources:
              - config
              - dynamic  # will add dynamic.example.com.
            targets:
              - route53
        
        ```
        
        You can configure it to only do `A` or `AAAA` by adding a `types` param to the
        provider config.
        
        ```yaml
          dynamic:
            class: octodns_ddns.DdnsSource
            types:
              - A
        ```
        
        ### Configuring lookup urls
        
        If you would like to use an alternate provider for looking up your address you
        can configure `urls` with `a` and/or `aaaa` with urls that return the address
        as the content of the response.
        
        ```yaml
          dynamic:
            class: octodns_ddns.DdnsSource
            urls:
              A: https://v4.ident.me/
              AAAA: https://v6.ident.me/
        ```
