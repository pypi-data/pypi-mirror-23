        When writing `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ code, special care must be
        taken to ensure that the code can be interrupted with ``CTRL-C``.
        Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython normally does not check for
        interrupts. For example, code like the following cannot be interrupted
        in Cython::
        
            while True:
                pass
        
        The ``cysignals`` package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
        signals and errors) in Cython code.
        
        See http://cysignals.readthedocs.org/ for the full documentation.
