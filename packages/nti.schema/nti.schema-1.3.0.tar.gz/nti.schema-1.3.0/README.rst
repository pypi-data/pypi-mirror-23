nti.schema offers a set of classes and functions that make
schema-based development with zope.schema easier.

For complete details and the changelog, see the `documentation <http://ntischema.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Overview
========

Some of the most useful features include:

- ``nti.schema.interfaces.find_most_derived_interface`` for finding a
  bounded interface.
- ``nti.schema.eqhash.EqHash`` is a class-decorator for creating
  efficient, correct implementations of equality and hashing.
- ``nti.schema.field`` contains various schema fields, including a
  ``Variant`` type and more flexible collection types, all of which
  produce better validation errors.
- ``nti.schema.fieldproperty`` contains field properties that can
  adapt to interfaces or decode incoming text. The function
  ``createDirectFieldProperties`` can assign just the necessary
  properties automatically.
