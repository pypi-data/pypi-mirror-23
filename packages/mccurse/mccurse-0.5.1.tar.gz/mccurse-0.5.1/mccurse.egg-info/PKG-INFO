        Minecraft Curse CLI Client
        ==========================
        
        This project is my humble attempt at creating an automated way of installing,
        updating and managing mods for my Minecraft games. Using 
        `Curse.RestProxy <https://github.com/amcoder/Curse.RestProxy>`_ as its primary
        data source, it can find mods and their updates on Minecraft `CurseForge`_ and
        automatically install them for you.
        
        .. _CurseForge: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The ``mccurse`` command provides various subcommands, described below.
        
        Querying
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        ``mccurse search TEXT`` – Search available mods on `CurseForge`_, then presents
        the user with list of possible matches. If the user choose one of them, it opens
        its project page in the default browser.
        
        Mod Management
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        All the commands below presume that they are run in the profile directory of
        a Minecraft instance.
        
        ``mccurse auth`` – Authenticate with your Curse account and store the auth token
        for later use.
        
        ``mccurse new VERSION`` – Initialize new metadata file for current profile,
        which will hold all the necessary info for installed mods. ``VERSION`` is the
        Minecraft version of the instance (i.e. ``1.10.2``).
        
        ``mccurse install MOD`` – Install new mod, including its required dependencies,
        to the current Minecraft instance.
        
        ``mccurse upgrade [all|MOD]`` – Upgrade mods to their latest version for current
        game version. ``all`` upgrades all mods with available upgrades, ``MOD`` only
        the specified one.
        
        ``mccurse remove MOD`` – Uninstall the ``MOD`` and its no longer needed
        dependencies.
