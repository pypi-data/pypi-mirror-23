A simple program that showing how to use WoodenWaiter
as a customer and producer

customer example:

.. code-block:: python

    import time

    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenWaiter
    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenCustomer
    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenManager

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        table1 = 'cmdb'
        table2 = 'rbac'
        dish1 = 'custom_sync'
        dish2 = 'some_task'
        waiter = WoodenWaiter()

        def print_foods(foods):
            print('custom foods')
            print('foods is: {}'.format(foods))

        customer1 = WoodenCustomer(
                table=table1, dish=dish1, waiter=waiter,
                process=print_foods, seconds=1)
        customer2 = WoodenCustomer(
                table=table2, dish=dish2, waiter=waiter,
                process=print_foods, seconds=3)

        manager = WoodenManager()
        manager.add_customer(customer1)
        manager.add_customer(customer2)
        manager.launch()

        while True:
            time.sleep(1)

producer example:

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    import random

    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenMenu
    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenWaiter
    from woodenwaiter.woodenwaiter import WoodenCooker

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        table1 = 'cmdb'
        table2 = 'rbac'
        dish1 = 'custom_sync'
        dish2 = 'some_task'
        foods1 = {
            "action": "sync_custom_data",
            "paras": ""
        }
        foods2 = {
            "action": "some_action",
            "paras": {
                "para1": "value1",
                "para2": "value2"
            }
        }
        menu1 = WoodenMenu(table=table1, dish=dish1, foods=foods1)
        menu2 = WoodenMenu(table=table2, dish=dish2, foods=foods2)
        waiter = WoodenWaiter()
        cooker1 = WoodenCooker(menu=menu1, waiter=waiter)
        cooker2 = WoodenCooker(menu=menu2, waiter=waiter)

        cooker_running = True
        def cook_sometime():
            while cooker_running:
                seconds = random.randint(3, 10)
                time.sleep(seconds)
                print('cookone after {} seconds'.format(seconds))
                cooker1.cookone()
                cooker2.cookone()

        cooker_thread = threading.Thread(target=cook_sometime)
        cooker_thread.start()

        while True:
            try:
                time.sleep(1)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                cooker_running = False
                manager.terminate_all()
                break

Interoduce Classes of WoodenWaiter

WoodenMenu
~~~~~~~~~~
Each WoodenCooker cook **ONE** kind of food according to **ONE** WoodenMenu
instance. We create WoodenMenu instance by offer a table(maybe your program
model), a dish(maybe one kinds of your task) and foods(some informations
the customer need)

suggested format of parameter 'foods':

.. code-block:: python

    foods = {

    }

WoodenWaiter

Each WoodenWater connect **ONE** redis database. We use WoodenWaiter to create
WoodenCooker instance and WoodenCustomer instance.

WoodenWater take dish from WoodenCooker(push task to redis list) and serve dish
to WoodenCustomer(pop task from redis).
