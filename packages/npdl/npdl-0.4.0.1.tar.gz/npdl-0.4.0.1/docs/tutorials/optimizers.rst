Optimizer
=========

Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by
far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art
Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient
descent (e.g. lasagne's [25]_, caffe's [26]_, and keras' [27]_ documentation). These algorithms,
however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths
and weaknesses are hard to come by.

This blog post aims at providing you with intuitions towards the behaviour of different
algorithms for optimizing gradient descent that will help you put them to use. We are first
going to look at the different variants of gradient descent. We will then briefly summarize
challenges during training. Subsequently, we will introduce the most common optimization
algorithms by showing their motivation to resolve these challenges and how this leads to
the derivation of their update rules. We will also take a short look at algorithms and
architectures to optimize gradient descent in a parallel and distributed setting. Finally,
we will consider additional strategies that are helpful for optimizing gradient descent.

Gradient descent is a way to minimize an objective function :math:`J(\theta)` parameterized
by a model's parameters :math:`\theta \in R^d` by updating the parameters in the opposite
direction of the gradient of the objective function :math:`\bigtriangledown_{\theta}J(\theta)`
w.r.t. to the parameters. The learning rate ηη determines the size of the steps we take to
reach a (local) minimum. In other words, we follow the direction of the slope of the surface
created by the objective function downhill until we reach a valley. If you are unfamiliar
with gradient descent, you can find a good introduction on optimizing neural networks here [28]_.


Gradient descent variants
=========================
There are three variants of gradient descent, which differ in how much data we use to compute
the gradient of the objective function. Depending on the amount of data, we make a trade-off
between the accuracy of the parameter update and the time it takes to perform an update.

Batch gradient descent
----------------------

Vanilla gradient descent, aka batch gradient descent, computes the gradient of the cost
function w.r.t. to the parameters :math:`\theta` for the entire training dataset:

.. math::

    \theta = \theta - \eta \ast \bigtriangledown_{\theta} J(\theta)

As we need to calculate the gradients for the whole dataset to perform just one update,
batch gradient descent can be very slow and is intractable for datasets that don't fit in
memory. Batch gradient descent also doesn't allow us to update our model online, i.e.
with new examples on-the-fly.

In code, batch gradient descent looks something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(nb_epochs):
        params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function, data, params)
        params = params - learning_rate * params_grad


For a pre-defined number of epochs, we first compute the gradient vector ``params_grad`` of
the loss function for the whole dataset w.r.t. our parameter vector ``params``. Note that
state-of-the-art deep learning libraries provide automatic differentiation that efficiently
computes the gradient w.r.t. some parameters. If you derive the gradients yourself,
then gradient checking is a good idea. (See here for some great tips on how to check gradients
properly.)

We then update our parameters in the direction of the gradients with the learning rate
determining how big of an update we perform. Batch gradient descent is guaranteed to converge
to the global minimum for convex error surfaces and to a local minimum for non-convex surfaces.


Stochastic gradient descent
---------------------------

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in contrast performs a parameter update for each training
example :math:`x^{(i)}` and label :math:`y^{(i)}`:

.. math::

    \theta = \theta - \eta \ast \bigtriangledown_{\theta}J(\theta;x^{(i)};y^{(i)})

Batch gradient descent performs redundant computations for large datasets, as it recomputes
gradients for similar examples before each parameter update. SGD does away with this redundancy
by performing one update at a time. It is therefore usually much faster and can also be used to learn online.

SGD performs frequent updates with a high variance that cause the objective function to
fluctuate heavily as in Image 1.

.. figure:: pics/optimizer_1.png

    Image 1: SGD fluctuation.

While batch gradient descent converges to the minimum of the basin the parameters are placed
in, SGD's fluctuation, on the one hand, enables it to jump to new and potentially better
local minima. On the other hand, this ultimately complicates convergence to the exact minimum,
as SGD will keep overshooting. However, it has been shown that when we slowly decrease the
learning rate, SGD shows the same convergence behaviour as batch gradient descent, almost
certainly converging to a local or the global minimum for non-convex and convex optimization
respectively.

Its code fragment simply adds a loop over the training examples and evaluates the gradient
w.r.t. each example. Note that we shuffle the training data at every epoch as explained
in :ref:`Shuffling-and-Curriculum-Learning`.

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(nb_epochs):
        np.random.shuffle(data)
        for example in data:
            params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function, example, params)
            params = params - learning_rate * params_grad


Mini-batch gradient descent
---------------------------

Mini-batch gradient descent finally takes the best of both worlds and performs an update
for every mini-batch of :math:`n` training examples:

.. math::

    \theta = \theta - \eta \ast \bigtriangledown_{\theta}J(\theta;x^{(i:i+n)};y^{(i:i+n)})

This way, it a) reduces the variance of the parameter updates, which can lead to more stable
convergence; and b) can make use of highly optimized matrix optimizations common to
state-of-the-art deep learning libraries that make computing the gradient w.r.t. a
mini-batch very efficient. Common mini-batch sizes range between 50 and 256, but can
vary for different applications. Mini-batch gradient descent is typically the algorithm of
choice when training a neural network and the term SGD usually is employed also when
mini-batches are used. Note: In modifications of SGD in the rest of this post, we leave
out the parameters :math:`x^{(i:i+n)};y^{(i:i+n)}` for simplicity.

In code, instead of iterating over examples, we now iterate over mini-batches of size 50:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(nb_epochs):
        np.random.shuffle(data)
        for batch in get_batches(data, batch_size=50):
            params_grad = evaluate_gradient(loss_function, batch, params)
            params = params - learning_rate * params_grad


Challenges
==========

Vanilla mini-batch gradient descent, however, does not guarantee good convergence,
but offers a few challenges that need to be addressed:

* Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult. A learning rate that is too small
  leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder
  convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge.
* Learning rate schedules [11]_ try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g.
  annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when
  the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and
  thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a
  dataset's characteristics [10]_.
* Additionally, the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. If our data
  is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to
  update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring
  features.
* Another key challenge of minimizing highly non-convex error functions common for
  neural networks is avoiding getting trapped in their numerous suboptimal local minima.
  Dauphin et al. [19]_ argue that the difficulty arises in fact not from local minima but
  from saddle points, i.e. points where one dimension slopes up and another slopes down.
  These saddle points are usually surrounded by a plateau of the same error, which makes
  it notoriously hard for SGD to escape, as the gradient is close to zero in all dimensions.


Gradient descent optimization algorithms
----------------------------------------

In the following, we will outline some algorithms that are widely used by the deep learning
community to deal with the aforementioned challenges. We will not discuss algorithms that
are infeasible to compute in practice for high-dimensional data sets, e.g. second-order
methods such as Newton's method [29]_.

Momentum
--------

SGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply
in one dimension than in another [1]_, which are common around local optima. In these scenarios,
SGD oscillates across the slopes of the ravine while only making hesitant progress along
the bottom towards the local optimum as in Image 2.

.. figure:: pics/optimizer_2.gif
    :width: 45%

    Image 2: SGD without momentum

.. figure:: pics/optimizer_3.gif
    :width: 45%

    Image 3: SGD with momentum

Momentum [2]_ is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens
oscillations as can be seen in Image 3. It does this by adding a fraction :math:`\gamma` of
the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector:

.. math::

    & v_{t} = \gamma v_{t-1} + \gamma \bigtriangledown_\theta J(\theta) \\
    & \theta = \theta - v_t

Note: Some implementations exchange the signs in the equations. The momentum term :math:`\gamma`
is usually set to 0.9 or a similar value.

Essentially, when using momentum, we push a ball down a hill. The ball accumulates momentum as
it rolls downhill, becoming faster and faster on the way (until it reaches its terminal velocity
if there is air resistance, i.e. :math:`\gamma<1`). The same thing happens to our parameter
updates: The momentum term increases for dimensions whose gradients point in the same directions
and reduces updates for dimensions whose gradients change directions. As a result, we gain
faster convergence and reduced oscillation.


Nesterov accelerated gradient
-----------------------------

However, a ball that rolls down a hill, blindly following the slope, is highly unsatisfactory.
We'd like to have a smarter ball, a ball that has a notion of where it is going so that it
knows to slow down before the hill slopes up again.

Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) [7]_ is a way to give our momentum term this kind of
prescience. We know that we will use our momentum term :math:`\gamma v_{t−1}` to move the
parameters :math:`0`. Computing :math:`\theta - \gamma v_{t-1}` thus gives us an approximation
of the next position of the parameters (the gradient is missing for the full update), a rough
idea where our parameters are going to be. We can now effectively look ahead by calculating
the gradient not w.r.t. to our current parameters θθ but w.r.t. the approximate future
position of our parameters:

.. math::

    & v_{t} = \gamma v_{t-1} + \eta \bigtriangledown_\theta J(\theta - \gamma v_{t-1}) \\
    & \theta = \theta - v_t

Again, we set the momentum term γγ to a value of around 0.9. While Momentum first computes
the current gradient (small blue vector in Image 4) and then takes a big jump in the direction
of the updated accumulated gradient (big blue vector), NAG first makes a big jump in the
direction of the previous accumulated gradient (brown vector), measures the gradient and then
makes a correction (red vector), which results in the complete NAG update (green vector).
This anticipatory update prevents us from going too fast and results in increased
responsiveness, which has significantly increased the performance of RNNs on a number of tasks [8]_.

.. figure:: pics/optimizier_4.png

    Image 4: Nesterov update

Refer to here for another explanation about the intuitions behind NAG, while Ilya Sutskever
gives a more detailed overview in his PhD thesis [9]_.

Now that we are able to adapt our updates to the slope of our error function and speed up
SGD in turn, we would also like to adapt our updates to each individual parameter to
perform larger or smaller updates depending on their importance.

Adagrad
-------

Adagrad [3]_ is an algorithm for gradient-based optimization that does just this: It
adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent and
smaller updates for frequent parameters. For this reason, it is well-suited for dealing
with sparse data. Dean et al. [4]_ have found that Adagrad greatly improved the robustness
of SGD and used it for training large-scale neural nets at Google, which -- among other
things -- learned to recognize cats in Youtube videos [30]_. Moreover, Pennington et
al. [5]_ used Adagrad to train GloVe word embeddings, as infrequent words require much
larger updates than frequent ones.

Previously, we performed an update for all parameters :math:`\theta` at once as every
parameter :math:`\theta_{i}` used the same learning rate :math:`\eta`. As Adagrad uses a
different learning rate for every parameter :math:`\theta_{i}` at every time step :math:`t`,
we first show Adagrad's per-parameter update, which we then vectorize. For brevity,
we set :math:`g_{t,i}` to be the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. to the
parameter :math:`θ_i` at time step tt:

.. math::

    g_{t,i}=\bigtriangledown_\theta J(\theta_i)


The SGD update for every parameter :math:`θ_i` at each time step :math:`t` then becomes:

.. math::

    \theta_{t+1,i}=\theta_{t,i}−\eta \ast g_{t,i}

In its update rule, Adagrad modifies the general learning rate ηη at each time step :math:`t`
for every parameter :math:`θ_i` based on the past gradients that have been computed for :math:`θ_i`:

.. math::

    \theta_{t+1,i} = \theta_{t,i} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_{t,ii}+\epsilon}} \ast g_{t,i}

:math:`G_{t} \in R^{d \times d}` here is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal
element :math:`i,i` is the sum of the squares of the gradients w.r.t. :math:`θ_i` up to time
step :math:`t` [24]_, while :math:`\epsilon` is a smoothing term that avoids division by zero
(usually on the order of :math:`1e−8`). Interestingly, without the square root operation,
the algorithm performs much worse.

As :math:`G_t` contains the sum of the squares of the past gradients w.r.t. to all
parameters :math:`\theta` along its diagonal, we can now vectorize our implementation
by performing an element-wise matrix-vector multiplication :math:`\bigodot` between :math:`G_t`
and :math:`g_t`:

.. math::

    \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_{t}+\epsilon}} \bigodot g_{t}

One of Adagrad's main benefits is that it eliminates the need to manually tune the learning rate.
Most implementations use a default value of 0.01 and leave it at that.

Adagrad's main weakness is its accumulation of the squared gradients in the denominator: Since
every added term is positive, the accumulated sum keeps growing during training. This in turn
causes the learning rate to shrink and eventually become infinitesimally small, at which point
the algorithm is no longer able to acquire additional knowledge. The following algorithms aim
to resolve this flaw.


Adadelta
--------

Adadelta [6]_ is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically
decreasing learning rate. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts
the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size :math:`w`.

Instead of inefficiently storing ww previous squared gradients, the sum of gradients is
recursively defined as a decaying average of all past squared gradients. The running average :math:`E[g^2]_t`
at time step tt then depends (as a fraction :math:`\gamma` similarly to the Momentum term)
only on the previous average and the current gradient:

.. math::

    E[g^2]_t = \gamma E[g^2]_{t-1} + (1-\gamma) g_t^2

We set :math:`\gamma` to a similar value as the momentum term, around 0.9. For clarity, we now
rewrite our vanilla SGD update in terms of the parameter update vector :math:`\bigtriangleup \theta_{t}`:

.. math::

    & \bigtriangleup \theta_{t} = - \eta \ast g_{t,i} \\
    & \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} + \bigtriangleup \theta_{t}

The parameter update vector of Adagrad that we derived previously thus takes the form:

.. math::

    \bigtriangleup \theta_{t} = - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_{t}+\epsilon}} \bigodot g_{t}

We now simply replace the diagonal matrix :math:`G_t` with the decaying average over past squared
gradients :math:`E[g^2]_t`:

.. math::

    \bigtriangleup \theta_{t} = - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t+\epsilon}} \bigodot g_{t}

As the denominator is just the root mean squared (RMS) error criterion of the gradient, we can
replace it with the criterion short-hand:

.. math::

    \bigtriangleup \theta_{t} = - \frac{\eta}{RMS[g]_{t}} g_t

The authors note that the units in this update (as well as in SGD, Momentum, or Adagrad)
do not match, i.e. the update should have the same hypothetical units as the parameter.
To realize this, they first define another exponentially decaying average, this time not
of squared gradients but of squared parameter updates:

.. math::

    E[\bigtriangleup \theta^2] = \gamma E[\bigtriangleup \theta^2]_{t-1} + (1-\gamma)\bigtriangleup \theta^2

The root mean squared error of parameter updates is thus:

.. math::

    RMS[\bigtriangleup \theta]_{t} = \sqrt{E(\bigtriangleup \theta^2)_t + \epsilon}

Since :math:`RMS[\bigtriangleup \theta]_{t}` is unknown, we approximate it with the RMS
of parameter updates until the previous time step. Replacing the learning rate :math:`\eta`
in the previous update rule with :math:`RMS[\bigtriangleup \theta]_{t-1}` finally yields the
Adadelta update rule:

.. math::

    & \bigtriangleup \theta_{t} = - \frac{RMS[\bigtriangleup \theta]_{t-1}}{RMS[\bigtriangleup \theta]_{t}} g_t \\
    & \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} + \bigtriangleup \theta_{t}

With Adadelta, we do not even need to set a default learning rate, as it has been eliminated
from the update rule.

RMSprop
-------

RMSprop is an unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton in
Lecture 6e of his Coursera Class [31]_.

RMSprop and Adadelta have both been developed independently around the same time stemming
from the need to resolve Adagrad's radically diminishing learning rates. RMSprop in fact
is identical to the first update vector of Adadelta that we derived above:

.. math::

    & E[g^2]_t = 0.9 E[g^2]_{t-1} + 0.1 g_t^2 \\
    & theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t + \epsilon}} g_t

RMSprop as well divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared
gradients. Hinton suggests :math:`\gamma` to be set to 0.9, while a good default value for
the learning rate :math:`\eta` is 0.001.


Adam
----

Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) [15]_ is another method that computes adaptive learning
rates for each parameter. In addition to storing an exponentially decaying average of past
squared gradients :math:`v_t` like Adadelta and RMSprop, Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying
average of past gradients :math:`m_t`, similar to momentum:

.. math::

    & m_t=\beta_1 m_{t−1}+(1−\beta_1)g_t \\
    & v_t=\beta_2 v_t−1+(1−\beta_2)g_t^2

:math:`m_t` and :math:`v_t` are estimates of the first moment (the mean) and the second
moment (the uncentered variance) of the gradients respectively, hence the name of the
method. As :math:`m_t` and :math:`v_t` are initialized as vectors of 0's, the authors
of Adam observe that they are biased towards zero, especially during the initial time
steps, and especially when the decay rates are small (i.e. :math:`\beta_1`
and :math:`\beta_2` are close to 1).

They counteract these biases by computing bias-corrected first and second moment estimates:

.. math::

    & \widehat{m_t} = \frac{m_{t}}{1-\beta_1^t} \\
    & \widehat{v_t} = \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t}

They then use these to update the parameters just as we have seen in Adadelta and
RMSprop, which yields the Adam update rule:

.. math::

    \theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\widehat{v_t}}+\epsilon} \widehat{m_t}

The authors propose default values of 0.9 for :math:`\beta_1`, 0.999 for :math:`\beta_2`,
and :math:`10−8` for :math:`\epsilon`. They show empirically that Adam works well in
practice and compares favorably to other adaptive learning-method algorithms.



Visualization of algorithms
---------------------------

The following two animations provide some intuitions towards the optimization behaviour
of the presented optimization algorithms. Also have a look here [32]_ for a description
of the same images by Karpathy and another concise overview of the algorithms discussed.

.. figure:: pics/optimizer_5.gif

    Image 5: SGD optimization on loss surface contours

.. figure:: pics/optimizer_6.gif

    Image 6: SGD optimization on saddle point

In Image 5, we see their behaviour on the contours of a loss surface over time. Note
that Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop almost immediately head off in the right direction
and converge similarly fast, while Momentum and NAG are led off-track, evoking the image
of a ball rolling down the hill. NAG, however, is quickly able to correct its course due
to its increased responsiveness by looking ahead and heads to the minimum.

Image 6 shows the behaviour of the algorithms at a saddle point, i.e. a point where one
dimension has a positive slope, while the other dimension has a negative slope, which pose
a difficulty for SGD as we mentioned before. Notice here that SGD, Momentum, and NAG find
it difficulty to break symmetry, although the two latter eventually manage to escape the
saddle point, while Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adadelta quickly head down the negative slope.

As we can see, the adaptive learning-rate methods, i.e. Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and
Adam are most suitable and provide the best convergence for these scenarios.

Which optimizer to choose?
--------------------------

So, which optimizer should you now use? If your input data is sparse, then you likely
achieve the best results using one of the adaptive learning-rate methods. An additional
benefit is that you won't need to tune the learning rate but likely achieve the best
results with the default value.

In summary, RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that deals with its radically diminishing
learning rates. It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter
updates in the numinator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to
RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in
similar circumstances. Kingma et al. [15]_ show that its bias-correction helps Adam
slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser.
Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice.

Interestingly, many recent papers use vanilla SGD without momentum and a simple learning
rate annealing schedule. As has been shown, SGD usually achieves to find a minimum, but
it might take significantly longer than with some of the optimizers, is much more reliant
on a robust initialization and annealing schedule, and may get stuck in saddle points rather
than local minima. Consequently, if you care about fast convergence and train a deep or
complex neural network, you should choose one of the adaptive learning rate methods.



Parallelizing and distributing SGD
=====================================

Given the ubiquity of large-scale data solutions and the availability of low-commodity
clusters, distributing SGD to speed it up further is an obvious choice.

SGD by itself is inherently sequential: Step-by-step, we progress further towards the
minimum. Running it provides good convergence but can be slow particularly on large datasets.
In contrast, running SGD asynchronously is faster, but suboptimal communication between
workers can lead to poor convergence. Additionally, we can also parallelize SGD on one
machine without the need for a large computing cluster. The following are algorithms and
architectures that have been proposed to optimize parallelized and distributed SGD.


Hogwild!
--------

Niu et al. [23]_ introduce an update scheme called Hogwild! that allows performing SGD
updates in parallel on CPUs. Processors are allowed to access shared memory without locking
the parameters. This only works if the input data is sparse, as each update will only modify
a fraction of all parameters. They show that in this case, the update scheme achieves almost
an optimal rate of convergence, as it is unlikely that processors will overwrite useful
information.


Downpour SGD
------------

Downpour SGD is an asynchronous variant of SGD that was used by Dean et al. [4]_ in their
DistBelief framework (predecessor to TensorFlow) at Google. It runs multiple replicas of
a model in parallel on subsets of the training data. These models send their updates to
a parameter server, which is split across many machines. Each machine is responsible for
storing and updating a fraction of the model's parameters. However, as replicas don't
communicate with each other e.g. by sharing weights or updates, their parameters are
continuously at risk of diverging, hindering convergence.


Delay-tolerant Algorithms for SGD
---------------------------------

McMahan and Streeter [12]_ extend AdaGrad to the parallel setting by developing
delay-tolerant algorithms that not only adapt to past gradients, but also to the update
delays. This has been shown to work well in practice.


TensorFlow
----------

TensorFlow [13]_ is Google's recently open-sourced framework for the implementation and
deployment of large-scale machine learning models. It is based on their experience with
DistBelief and is already used internally to perform computations on a large range of
mobile devices as well as on large-scale distributed systems. For distributed execution,
a computation graph is split into a subgraph for every device and communication takes
place using Send/Receive node pairs. However, the open source version of TensorFlow
currently does not support distributed functionality (see here [33]_). Update 13.04.16: A
distributed version of TensorFlow has been released [34]_.


Elastic Averaging SGD
---------------------

Zhang et al. [14]_ propose Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD), which links the parameters of
the workers of asynchronous SGD with an elastic force, i.e. a center variable stored by
the parameter server. This allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center
variable, which in theory allows for more exploration of the parameter space. They show
empirically that this increased capacity for exploration leads to improved performance by
finding new local optima.


Additional strategies for optimizing SGD
===========================================

Finally, we introduce additional strategies that can be used alongside any of the
previously mentioned algorithms to further improve the performance of SGD. For a great
overview of some other common tricks, refer to [22]_.


.. _Shuffling-and-Curriculum-Learning:

Shuffling and Curriculum Learning
---------------------------------

Generally, we want to avoid providing the training examples in a meaningful order to
our model as this may bias the optimization algorithm. Consequently, it is often a good
idea to shuffle the training data after every epoch.

On the other hand, for some cases where we aim to solve progressively harder problems,
supplying the training examples in a meaningful order may actually lead to improved
performance and better convergence. The method for establishing this meaningful order
is called Curriculum Learning [16]_.

Zaremba and Sutskever [17]_ were only able to train LSTMs to evaluate simple programs
using Curriculum Learning and show that a combined or mixed strategy is better than the
naive one, which sorts examples by increasing difficulty.


Batch normalization
-------------------
To facilitate learning, we typically normalize the initial values of our parameters
by initializing them with zero mean and unit variance. As training progresses and we
update parameters to different extents, we lose this normalization, which slows down
training and amplifies changes as the network becomes deeper.

Batch normalization [18]_ reestablishes these normalizations for every mini-batch and
changes are back-propagated through the operation as well. By making normalization part
of the model architecture, we are able to use higher learning rates and pay less attention
to the initialization parameters. Batch normalization additionally acts as a regularizer,
reducing (and sometimes even eliminating) the need for Dropout.


Early Stopping
--------------

According to Geoff Hinton: "Early stopping (is) beautiful free lunch" (NIPS 2015 Tutorial
slides, slide 63) [35]_. You should thus always monitor error on a validation set during
training and stop (with some patience) if your validation error does not improve enough.


Gradient noise
--------------

Neelakantan et al. [21]_ add noise that follows a Gaussian distribution :math:`N(0,\sigma_t^2)`
to each gradient update:

.. math::

    g_{t,i} = g_{t,i} + N(0, \sigma_t^2)

They anneal the variance according to the following schedule:

.. math::

    \sigma_t^2 = \frac{\eta}{(1+t)^{\gamma}}


They show that adding this noise makes networks more robust to poor initialization and
helps training particularly deep and complex networks. They suspect that the added noise
gives the model more chances to escape and find new local minima, which are more frequent
for deeper models.

Conclusion
=============

In this blog post, we have initially looked at the three variants of gradient descent,
among which mini-batch gradient descent is the most popular. We have then investigated
algorithms that are most commonly used for optimizing SGD: Momentum, Nesterov accelerated
gradient, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, as well as different algorithms to optimize
asynchronous SGD. Finally, we've considered other strategies to improve SGD such as shuffling
and curriculum learning, batch normalization, and early stopping.
