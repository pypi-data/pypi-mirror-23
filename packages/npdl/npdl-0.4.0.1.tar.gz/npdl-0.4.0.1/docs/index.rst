
Hi, NumpyDL
===========

NumpyDL is a simple deep learning library based on pure Python/Numpy. NumpyDL
is a work in progress, input is welcome. The project is on
`GitHub <https://github.com/oujago/NumpyDL>`_.

The main features of NumpyDL are as follows:

1. *Pure* in Numpy
2. *Native* to Python
3. *Automatic differentiations* are basically supported
4. *Commonly used models* are provided: MLP, RNNs, LSTMs and CNNs
5. *API* like ``Keras`` library
6. *Examples* for several AI tasks
7. *Application* for a toy chatbot


User Guides
===========

The NumpyDL user guide explains how to install NumpyDL, how to build and train
neural networks using NumpyDL, and how to contribute to the library as a
developer.
