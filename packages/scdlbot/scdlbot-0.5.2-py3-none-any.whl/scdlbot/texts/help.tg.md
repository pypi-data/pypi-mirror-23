*I download and send audios of tracks/sets/albums in MP3 128 kbps with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to bot-sent file size limit. Supported sites:*
*• SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists
*• Bandcamp*: tracks/albums, non-`bandcamp.com` links work only with `/dl <link>`
*• YouTube*: videos/playlists
*• Mixcloud*: unstable and slow

*Usage:*
• Send a message with links to the chat and I will download them instantly in private or ask you in groups. [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_ so I parse all group messages for links. Forwarded messages work too. For example:
`Check it out! https://m.soundcloud.com/richarddjames/umil-25-01 and also https://shitmat.bandcamp.com/track/amen-babylon-2016-mix`
• Use `/dl <link(-s)>` command to download instantly in groups.
