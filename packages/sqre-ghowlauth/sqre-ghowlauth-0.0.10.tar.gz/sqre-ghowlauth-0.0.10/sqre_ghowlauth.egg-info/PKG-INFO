Description: # sqre-ghowlauth
        
        GitHub Organization WhiteList Authentication
        
        JupyterHub authentication that uses GitHub OAuth2 but additionally
        checks user org membership against a list defined in the environment
        variable `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_WHITELIST`.
        
        ## Installation
        
        sqre-ghowlauth runs on Python 3.3 or greater. You can install it with
        
        ```bash
        pip install sqre-ghowlauth
        ```
        
        This will also install dependencies: `jupyterhub` and `tornado`.
        
        ## Example usage
        
        Your `jupyterhub_config.py` file should contain
        `c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'ghowlauth.GHOWLAuthenticator'` (or
        you can use `LocalGHOWLAuthenticator` to handle both local and GitHub
        auth).
        
        You also must have set the environment variable
        `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_WHITELIST` to be a comma-separated list of organizations
        whose members you want to permit,
        e.g. `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_WHITELIST=lsst,lsst-sqre`.
        
        The rest of the instructions are the same as those found at
        https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator (that is, you still need a
        callback URL, a client ID, and a client secret).
