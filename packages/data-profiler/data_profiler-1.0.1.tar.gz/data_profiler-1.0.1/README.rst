data\_profiler
==============

The data\_profiler module extends the standard CPython profiler by
recording the functions' signatures. For NumPy array types this includes
the ``dtype`` attribute and the array's shape.

It also adds functionality to visualise the augmented profile table in
snakeviz.

This module is a direct port of ``Accelerate.profiler`` available in
`Anaconda
Accelerate <https://docs.continuum.io/accelerate/profiling>`__.

Documentation is located `here <LINK_TO_DOCS>`__

Installing
----------

The easiest way to install data\_profiler and get updates is by using
the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__

::

    #> conda install data_profiler

To compile, test and run from source, it is recommended to create a
conda environment containing the following:

-  numpy
-  numba >=0.26.0
-  snakeviz
-  jupyter
-  pytest

for instructions on how to do this see the
`conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`__ documentation, specifically the
section on `managing
environments <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html#managing-environments>`__.

Once a suitable environment is activated, installation achieved simply
by running:

::

    #> python setup.py install

and the installation can be tested with:

::

    #> pytest

Building Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to build a local copy of the documentation from
source. This requires GNU Make and sphinx (available via conda).

Documentation is stored in the ``doc`` folder, and should be built with:

::

    #> make SPHINXOPTS=-Wn clean html

This ensures that the documentation renders without errors. If errors
occur, they can all be seen at once by building with:

::

    #> make SPHINXOPTS=-n clean html

However, these errors should all be fixed so that building with ``-Wn``
is possible prior to merging any documentation changes or updates.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

Continuous integration is provided by `Travis
CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`__, the current build state is available
`here <LINK_TO_TRAVIS_BUILD>`__.
