SAND
----

Python code and notebooks to model System Architecture as a Network of Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAND uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to explore applications of
representing system architecture as a directed graph, or network, of
engineered artifacts and their relationships to one another.

Engineered artifacts are vertices in the graph. For a software library,
the artifacts are functions and the dependencies are function calls. For
RESTful microservices, an artifact is a service and the dependencies are
API calls.

Directed edges represent the dependencies and their transpose, impact.

Imagine we have two microservices, A and B.

If B calls A, then B has a dependency on A. The creator of A might not
know that B is a client, so the dependency relationship is directed.

The transpose of this relationship is that A impacts or influences B:
Non backwards-compatible changes in A's interface that B calls can break
B. Changes in B do not impact A, so once again, the edge is directed.

This simple model proves to be extremely powerful in describing
arbitrarily complicated system architectures. The SAND library and
accompanying Jupyter Notebooks provide working examples of visualization
and analysis.

Installing
----------

1. You'll also need a working Jupyter installation running on Python 3.

2. Start Jupyter in the ``sandbook`` directory:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:testedminds/sand.git
    cd sand
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd docs
    jupyter notebook

3. `Install Cytoscape <http://cytoscape.org/>`__. Start Cytoscape up and
   close the welcome screen. You probably want to check "Don't show
   again" in the lower left.

Getting Started

See a presentation from Bobby Norton at `Windy City
GraphDB <https://github.com/bobbyno/windy-city-graphdb-9-22-16/blob/master/windy_city_graphdb_presentation.ipynb>`__
for a more detailed introduction to the concept.

The Notebooks leverage `Cytoscape's RESTful
API <http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest>`__ and
`python-igraph <http://igraph.org/python/>`__.
