Description: =========
        Mail Save
        =========
        
        Save emails to a file. It can be used as a replacement for sendmail or a SMTP server.
        
        You can install it with ``pip install mailsave`` or ``pip install --user mailsave``
        
        You can also use the single `file version <https://framagit.org/Jenselme/mailsave/tree/master/dist/mailsave.py>`__. Since mailsave only needs the standard library, you don't have anything to install.
        
        It is different from other tools like `maildump <https://pypi.org/project/maildump/>`__ because:
        
        - It is very minimalist: no Web or GUI interface, just files.
        - It can be used instead of sendmail.
        
        To use in place of sendmail, just put the path to the ``mailsave`` executable instead of the sendmail one. For instance, in a ``php.ini`` file:
        
        ::
        
            sendmail_path = /home/jenselme/.virtualenvs/test/bin/mailsave --dir mails
        
        To use as an SMTP server, launch it like this:
        
        ::
        
            mailsave --server --dir logs
        
        To view the full help, use:
        
        ::
        
            mailsave --help
