.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
cdist is the frontend executable to the cdist configuration management.
It supports different subcommands as explained below.
.sp
It is written in Python so it requires \fBpython\fP(1) to be installed.
It requires a minimal Python version 3.2.
.SH GENERAL
.sp
All commands accept the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show the help screen
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Quiet mode: disables logging, including WARNING and ERROR
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase the verbosity level. Every instance of \-v increments the verbosity
level by one. Its default value is 0 which includes ERROR and WARNING levels.
The levels, in order from the lowest to the highest, are:
ERROR (\-1), WARNING (0), INFO (1), VERBOSE (2), DEBUG (3) TRACE (4 or higher).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version and exit
.UNINDENT
.SH BANNER
.sp
Displays the cdist banner. Useful for printing
cdist posters \- a must have for every office.
.SH CONFIG/INSTALL
.sp
Configure/install one or more hosts.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-beta
Enable beta functionality.
.sp
Can also be enabled using CDIST_BETA env var.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C CACHE_PATH_PATTERN, \-\-cache\-path\-pattern CACHE_PATH_PATTERN
Sepcify custom cache path pattern. It can also be set by
CDIST_CACHE_PATH_PATTERN environment variable. If it is not set then
default hostdir is used. For more info on format see
\fBCACHE PATH PATTERN FORMAT\fP below.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c CONF_DIR, \-\-conf\-dir CONF_DIR
Add a configuration directory. Can be specified multiple times.
If configuration directories contain conflicting types, explorers or
manifests, then the last one found is used. Additionally this can also
be configured by setting the CDIST_PATH environment variable to a colon
delimited list of config directories. Directories given with the
\-\-conf\-dir argument have higher precedence over those set through the
environment variable.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f HOSTFILE, \-\-file HOSTFILE
Read specified file for a list of additional hosts to operate on
or if \(aq\-\(aq is given, read stdin (one host per line).
If no host or host file is specified then, by default,
read hosts from stdin. For the file format see
\fBHOSTFILE FORMAT\fP below.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-remote\-copy REMOTE_COPY
Command to use for remote copy (should behave like scp)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-remote\-exec REMOTE_EXEC
Command to use for remote execution (should behave like ssh)
.UNINDENT
.SS HOSTFILE FORMAT
.sp
The HOSTFILE contains one host per line.
A comment is started with \(aq#\(aq and continues to the end of the line.
Any leading and trailing whitespace on a line is ignored.
Empty lines are ignored/skipped.
.sp
The Hostfile lines are processed as follows. First, all comments are
removed. Then all leading and trailing whitespace characters are stripped.
If such a line results in empty line it is ignored/skipped. Otherwise,
host string is used.
.SS CACHE PATH PATTERN FORMAT
.sp
Cache path pattern specifies path for a cache directory subdirectory.
In the path, \(aq%N\(aq will be substituted by the target host, \(aq%h\(aq will
be substituted by the calculated host directory, \(aq%P\(aq will be substituted
by the current process id. All format codes that
\fBpython\fP \fBdatetime.strftime()\fP function supports, except
\(aq%h\(aq, are supported. These date/time directives format cdist config/install
start time.
.sp
If empty pattern is specified then default calculated host directory
is used.
.sp
Calculated host directory is a hash of a host cdist operates on.
.sp
Resulting path is used to specify cache path subdirectory under which
current host cache data are saved.
.SH SHELL
.sp
This command allows you to spawn a shell that enables access
to the types as commands. It can be thought as an
"interactive manifest" environment. See below for example
usage. Its primary use is for debugging type parameters.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s SHELL, \-\-shell SHELL
Select shell to use, defaults to current shell. Used shell should
be POSIX compatible shell.
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ~/.cdist
Your personal cdist config directory. If exists it will be
automatically used.
.TP
.B cdist/conf
The distribution configuration directory. It contains official types and
explorers. This path is relative to cdist installation directory.
.UNINDENT
.SH NOTES
.sp
cdist detects if host is specified by IPv6 address. If so then remote_copy
command is executed with host address enclosed in square brackets
(see \fBscp\fP(1)).

.SH CAVEATS
.sp
When operating in parallel, either by operating in parallel for each host
(\-p/\-\-parallel) or by parallel jobs within a host (\-j/\-\-jobs), and depending
on target SSH server and its configuration you may encounter connection drops.
This is controlled with sshd \fBMaxStartups\fP configuration options.
You may also encounter session open refusal. This happens with ssh multiplexing
when you reach maximum number of open sessions permitted per network
connection. In this case ssh will disable multiplexing.
This limit is controlled with sshd \fBMaxSessions\fP configuration
options. For more details refer to \fBsshd_config\fP(5).
.sp
When requirements for the same object are defined in different manifests (see
example below), for example, in init manifest and in some other type manifest
and those requirements differ then dependency resolver cannot detect
dependencies correctly. This happens because cdist cannot prepare all objects first
and run all objects afterwards. Some object can depend on the result of type
explorer(s) and explorers are executed during object run. cdist will detect
such case and display a warning message. An example of such a case:
.INDENT 0.0
