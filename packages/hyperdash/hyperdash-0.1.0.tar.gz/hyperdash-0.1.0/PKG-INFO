        # How to use
        1) Explain thread model
        2) Explain that it captures STDOUT/STDERR
        3) Explain that it explicitly manages the logging package

        # Development
        
        ## Setup
        
        1) Clone the repo into your $GOPATH (repo must be somwhere under $GOPATH/src)
        2) In the root of the SDK directory, run `virtualenv env` to create a virtual environment
        3) Run `. env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
        4) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
        
        ## Testing
        TODO
        
        
        # Features
        
        ## Completed
        
        1) Capture STDOUT/STDERR and send them to server via websockets
        2) Make ServerManager resilient against network failures (buffer messages, auto retry / reconnects)
        3) Basic plumbing for logging
        4) Support for retrieving API key via hyperdash.json, HYPERDASH_API_KEY environment variable, and custom function.
        
        ## TODO:
        
        - Server authentication
        - Basic test suite / integration test
        - Confirm python 2.xx and 3.xxx compatibility
        - Ability to start / stop / restart jobs
        - Hyper-parameter injection / retrieval from server
        - Create logging handler to capture logs for users already using the logging package
        - Thread vs Process (to support efficient job-killing)
        - StringIO buffers and unicode
        - Maximum log size + truncate old logs
        - Local log files
