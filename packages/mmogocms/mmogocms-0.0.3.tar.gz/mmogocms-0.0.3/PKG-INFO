        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To get a basic website up and running
        
        
        1. Add this line to your admin/url.py file
        
        ```python
            url(r'', include('mmogo.routes.urls')),
        ```
        
        
        To use the ```BaseModel``` Abstract class for your models import the ```BaseModel``` as follows:
        
        ``` python 
        from mmogo.core.models import BaseModel
        
        class Post(BaseModel):
            pass
        
        ```
        
        If you want to add more fields on top of the ones on the BaseModel you can do so as follows:
        
        ``` python 
         from django.db import models
         from mmogo.core.models import BaseModel
        
        class Post(BaseModel):
            teaser = models.TextField()
        
        ```
