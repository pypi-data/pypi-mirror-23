        ## Installation
        
        ### Install using `pip`
        
        Make sure you have `pip` installed on your system, and then run:
        
        ```pip install utilbox```
        
        ### Install from sources
        
        *   Download the [latest release] from `GitHub` and extract it to a temporary location
        *   Open your terminal and `cd` to the extracted archive directory
        *   Run `python setup.py install`
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        Package dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The below rule should be applied in general when trying to use a utility class,
        
        > from utilbox.*<package_name>* import *<class_name>*
        
        For example to use the `FileUtils` class from `os_utils` package,
        
        > from utilbox.*os_utils* import *FileUtils*
        
        Here are some real-world scenarios where `utilbox` can serve your purposes,
        
        ### Example 1
        Let's say you want to fetch only the last line of some text file. To do this,
        
        ```python
        from utilbox.os_utils import FileUtils
        
        last_line = FileUtils.get_file_last_line("path/to/file.ext")
        print last_line
        ```
        
        ### Example 2
        What if you wanted the epoch time? No worries,
        
        ```python
        from utilbox.os_utils import SysUtils
        
        epoch_time = SysUtils.get_epoch_time()
        print epoch_time
        ```
        
        ### Example 3
        You can send an email just as easily,
        
        ```python
        from utilbox.mail_utils import MailUtils
        
        smtp_server = "192.168.0.1"
        sender_email_id = "someguy@example.com"
        
        mailer = MailUtils(smtp_server, sender_email_id)
        
        # send a plain-text message
        mailer.send_mail_plain("receiver@example2.com", "This is a test mail", sender_email_id, "This message was brought to you by 'utilbox'!")
        
        # send an HTML message
        mailer.send_mail_plain("receiver@example2.com", "This is a test mail", sender_email_id, "This message was brought to you by <b>'utilbox'<b>!")
        ```
