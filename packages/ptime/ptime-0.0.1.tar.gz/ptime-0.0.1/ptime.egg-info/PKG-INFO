Description: ptime
        =====
        
        A tool for measuring serial and parallel execution, and comparing the results.
        Provides an `IPython magic
        <http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html>`_ ``%ptime``.
        This can be useful for measuring the benefits of parallelizing code, including
        measuring the effect of the `Global Interpreter Lock
        <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock>`_ (GIL).
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code::
        
            In [1]: %load_ext ptime
        
            In [2]: import numpy as np
        
            In [3]: x = np.ones((5000, 10000))
        
            In [4]: %ptime x + x
            Total serial time:   0.42 s
            Total parallel time: 0.25 s
            For a 1.67X speedup across 2 threads
        
            In [5]: %ptime -n4 x + x  # use 4 threads
            Total serial time:   0.82 s
            Total parallel time: 0.31 s
            For a 2.60X speedup across 4 threads
        
            In [6]: res = %ptime -o x + x  # Get the result
            Total serial time:   0.41 s
            Total parallel time: 0.25 s
            For a 1.66X speedup across 2 threads
        
            In [7]: res.speedup
            Out[7]: 1.6610825669011922
        
            In [8]: %%ptime  # Use as a cell magic
            ...: x = np.ones((5000, 10000))
            ...: y = x + x
            ...:
            Total serial time:   0.72 s
            Total parallel time: 0.47 s
            For a 1.54X speedup across 2 threads
