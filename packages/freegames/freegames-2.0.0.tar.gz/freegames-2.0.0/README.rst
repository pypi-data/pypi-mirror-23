Free Python Games
=================

A collection (18) of free python games.

In the first half of 2012, I wrote ten games to teach a group of students some basics of programming. The goal was to have fun as much as it was to learn. Here you'll find simplified versions of several classics.

In 2013, I used these games again as part of a programming club for high school students at Downtown College Prep in San Jose, CA. At that time, I added a number of new games bringing the total up to eighteen and covering more advanced topics like projectile motion and encryption.

In 2014, I used these games as part of week-long programming club that met in the evenings at The River Church Community in San Jose, CA. Our demographic was middle and high school students.

Each game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along with a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and flexibility is important. There's no right or wrong way to implement a new feature! You never know which games the students will find really interesting.
