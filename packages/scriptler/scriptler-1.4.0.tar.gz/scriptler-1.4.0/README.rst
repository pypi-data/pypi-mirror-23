Scriptler allows you to manage scripts from different sources in one place with a simple configuration file.

installation
------------

As usual, use pip to install::

    $ pip install --user scriptler

usage
-----

First off, create a configuration file in ~/.config/scriptler/config.yml::

    scriptler:
        script_dir: /home/aljosha/.local/share/scriptler

    scripts:
        proxy-foxy:
            path: ~/git/scripts/bash/proxy-foxy
        socksme:
            path: ~/git/scripts/bash/socksme
        swap:
            path: bash/swap
            source: afriemann/scripts.git

    sources:
        afriemann/scripts.git:
            branch: master
            url: github.com/AFriemann/scripts

You can also add scripts and sources directly via the CLI::

    $ scriptler add source highlighter github.com/paoloantinori/hhighlighter
    $ scriptler add script h highlighter h.sh --command 'echo "h $@" >> {}'

Repository sections may be named however you please while script sections will determine the linked filename.
The command can be used to run commands after script installation. *{}* expands to the file. In this particular example it will
add "h" to the file since it normally only contains a function called "h".
The *scriptler* section is not required (~/.local/share/scriptler is the default) but *script_dir* should be something you have
write access to and can add to your $PATH.

To install the scripts, simply run::

    $ scriptler update
    installing socksme
    installing swap
    installing proxy-foxy
    installing h
    removing unmanaged file foobar

This will also remove unmanaged files (those that you removed from your configuration file/never added).

And to remove them again::

    $ scriptler remove
    removing swap
    removing proxy-foxy
    removing socksme
    removing h

To get a nice list of currently installed scripts::

    $ scriptler status
    config file  ~/.config/scriptler/config
    script dir   ~/.local/share/scriptler

    script     managed    installed
    ---------  ---------  -----------
    swap       yes        no
    h          yes        yes
    proxy-foxy yes        yes
    socksme    yes        yes
    foobar     no         yes

todo
----

* scriptler will ruthlessly reinstall files. Right now I don't care, but it would probably be better to change that
* the only sources supported right now are github and local files
* write some tests to ensure functionality
* *scriptler config edit* should not parse the config file beforehand and should check afterwards
* the command option for sources is very rudimentary and probably asking for tons of problems
