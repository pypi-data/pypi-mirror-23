Google Assistant SDK for Python
===============================

This package contains a collection of samples and tools to help you
get started with the `Google Assistant SDK`_ using `Python`_.

Installing
----------

- You can install using `pip`_::

    pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk

Usage
-----

google-oauthlib-tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool creates test credentials to authorize devices to call the
Google Assistant API when prototyping.

- `Follow the steps <https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-other-platforms/config-dev-project-and-account>`_ to configure a Google API Console Project and a Google account to use with the Google Assistant SDK.

- Download the ``client_secret_XXXXX.json`` file from the `Google API Console Project credentials section <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_ and generate credentials::

    pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
    google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets path/to/client_secret_XXXXX.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless

googlesamples-assistant-audiotest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool verifies device setup for audio recording and playback.

- Install the sample's dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
    pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk[samples]

- Record 10 seconds of audio samples and play them back::

    googlesamples-assistant-audiotest --record-time 10

- Adjust the sound device block size and flush size for a soundcard with limited throughput::

    googlesamples-assistant-audiotest --record-time 10 --audio-block-size=3200 --audio-flush-size=6400

The same ``--audio-block-size`` and ``--audio-flush-size`` options can
be used on the ``gRPC`` samples included in the SDK.

googlesamples-assistant-pushtotalk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This reference sample implements a simple but functional client for the `Google Assistant gRPC API`_.

- Install the sample's dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
    pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk[samples]

- Try the push to talk sample::

    googlesamples-assistant-pushtotalk

googlesamples-assistant-hotword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This reference sample implements a simple but functional client for the `Google Assistant library`_.

- Download the latest ``linux_arm7l`` wheel for the ``google_assistant_library`` from the `GitHub releases page`_.
- Install the ``google_assistant_library`` wheel and the samples dependencies using pip_::

    pip install --upgrade google_assistant_library-0.0.2-py2.py3-none-linux_armv7l.whl
    pip install --upgrade google-assistant-sdk[samples]

- Try the hotword sample::
