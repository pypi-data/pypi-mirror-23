        PhysicalQuantities is a python module that allows calculations to be aware 
        of physical units with a focus on engineering applications. 
        Built-in unit conversion ensures that calculations will result in the correct aggregate unit.
        
        The module also contains an extension for IPython. This allows greatly simplified use by typing in physical quantities
        directly as number and unit.
        
        ```
        In [1]: a = 100mm
        
        In [2]: a
        Out[2]: 100 mm
        
        In [3]: a.cm
        Out[3]: 10.0 cm
        
        In [4]: a = 10_000_000 nm
        
        In [5]: a.autoscale
        Out[5]: 1.0 cm
        
        In [6]: g = 9.81 m/s
        
        In [7]: g
        Out[7]: 9.81 m/s
        ```
        
        dB calculations are supported, too:
        
        ```
        In [1]: u = 10V
        
        In [2]: u.dB
        Out[2]: 20.0 dBV
        
        In [3]: p = 10 dBm
        
        In [4]: p
        Out[4]: 10 dBm
        
        In [5]: p.W
        Out[5]: 0.01 W
        
        In [6]: p.mW
        Out[6]: 10.0 mW
        ```
        
        Additional units, e.g. imperial units:
        
        ```
        In [1]: %precision 2
        Out[1]: '%.2f'
        
        In [2]: import  PhysicalQuantities.imperial
        
        In [3]: a = 2 inch
        
        In [4]: a
        Out[4]: 2 inch
        
        In [5]: a.mil
        Out[5]: 2000.00 mil
        
        In [6]: a.mm
        Out[6]: 50.80 mm
        ```
        
        
        This module is originally based on the IPython extension by Georg Brandl 
        (<https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics>). It was heavily extended to improve the
        ease of use.
