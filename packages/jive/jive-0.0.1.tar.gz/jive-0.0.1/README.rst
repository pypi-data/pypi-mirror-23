Overview
========

Angle based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) is a
dimensionality reduction algorithm for the multi-block setting i.e. K
different data matrices, with the same set of observations and
(possibly) different numbers of variables) **AJIVE finds *joint* modes
of variation which are common to all K data blocks as well as modes of
*individual* variation which are specific to each block.** For a
detailed discussion of AJIVE see `Angle-Based Joint and Individual
Variation Explained`_.

An R version of this package can be found `**here**`_.

Installation
============

Clone the repo:

::

    git clone https://github.com/idc9/jive.git
    python setup.py install

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from jive.jive import jive
    from jive.jive_visualization import plot_jive_full_estimates
        
    # load some example data
    X = np.load('data/toy_ajive_fig2_x.npy')
    Y = np.load('data/toy_ajive_fig2_y.npy')
    blocks = [X, Y]
        
    # fit JIVE
    jive = Jive(blocks, wedin_estimate=True)
    jive.set_signal_ranks([2, 3]) # select signal ranks based on scree plot
        
    # get all JIVE estimated data
    block_estimates = jive.get_block_estimates()
        
    # plot full JIVE estimates
    plot_jive_full_estimates(jive)

For some more example code see `this notebook`_.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source code is located on github:
`https://github.com/idc9/py\_jive`_. Currently the best math reference
is the `AJIVE paper`_.

Testing
^^^^^^^

Testing is done using `nose`_.

Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We welcome contributions to make this a stronger package: data examples,
bug fixes, spelling errors, new features, etc.

Citation
^^^^^^^^

A `Journal of Statistical Software`_ is hopefully coming soonâ€¦
