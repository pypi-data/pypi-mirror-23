Clid is a command line app written in Python3 to manage your mp3 files' ID3 tags.
Unlike other tools, clid provides a graphical interface in the terminal to edit
tags, much like the way `cmus <https://github.com/cmus/cmus>`_ does for playing
mp3 files in the terminal.

See the `homepage <https://github.com/GokulSoumya/clid>`_ for more details.
