ufodiff |Build Status| |Build status|
-------------------------------------

ufodiff is a command line source file diff tool for typefaces that are
developed with UFO source.

It examines git repositories for changes to files that are part of the
UFO source spec.

Currently, UFO version 2 is fully supported and UFO version 3 is
partially supported.

Current Release Status
----------------------

Unstable development version.

`Changelog <https://github.com/source-foundry/ufodiff/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__

Install
-------

Installation with ``pip`` is recommended:

``$ pip install ufodiff``

Usage
-----

``ufodiff`` is a command line executable. Application features are
accessed via subcommands to the ``ufodiff`` executable.

Execute ``ufodiff`` inside your git repository. It will recursively test
for the repository root from up to 4 levels of repository directory
depth. If you are receiving exceptions due to inability to instantiate
your git repository object, try bumping your working directory up a few
levels closer to the root. There are otherwise no restrictions to where
``ufodiff`` is executed in the repository.

View Results in Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, data are displayed in your terminal. Use one of the
following approaches to either pipe data to another application or write
data to a file.

Piping Data to Other Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``|`` idiom to pipe the standard output stream from ``ufodiff``
to another application for further processing like this:

::

    $ ufodiff deltajson all commits:3 | anotherapp --dosomething-with-json

File Writes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``>`` idiom to write the data in the standard output stream to a
filepath like this:

::

    $ ufodiff delta all commits:1 > myfont_delta.txt

Subcommand List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   <h3 id="delta">

delta

.. raw:: html

   </h4>

``ufo delta`` generates file modification, addition, and deletion
reports over a user specified number of commits in text format. The data
are streamed through standard output in a newline delimited fashion with
indicators for the type of file change.

The file change indicators include:

-  **[A]** file added
-  **[D]** file deleted
-  **[M]** file modified

For Markdown formatted data, see the ``deltamd`` command. For JSON
formatted data, see the ``deltajson`` subcommand.

::

    Subcommands:

    - delta         --- HEAD vs. user defined previous commits as text output to standard output stream
       - all

    Examples:
      ufodiff delta all commits:3 <optional UFO filter>

Increase or decrease the integer value after the ``commits:`` argument
to change the depth of the git commit history that you want to examine.

Add one or more optional UFO source base filenames (e.g.
Font-Regular.ufo) as last positional arguments in your command to filter
the delta analysis by individual source directories.

    Example:
      ufodiff deltajson all commits:3 <optional UFO filter>

JSON data are formatted as follows:

.. code:: json

    {
        "commits": [
          "25087a1ab",
          "27fdb2e48",
          "6edab459e"

          "filepath 2",
          "filepath 3"
        ],
        "deleted": [
          "filepath 1",
          "filepath 2",
          "filepath 3"
        ],
        "modified": [
          "filepath 1",
          "filepath 2",
          "filepath 3"
        ]
    }

Increase or decrease the integer value after the ``commits:`` argument
