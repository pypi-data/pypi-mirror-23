source.

Current Status

Unstable development release

Usage
~~~~~

Subcommands:

-  delta --- text output to standard output stream
-  deltajson --- json output to standard output stream

Examples:

``ufodiff delta all commits:3``

``ufodiff deltajson all commits:3``

Increase or decrease integer value after the ``commit:`` argument to
modify evaluation to that number of previous commits in the git
repository.

Add one or more optional UFO source filepaths (e.g. Font-Regular.ufo) as
last positional arguments in your command to filter the delta analysis
by individual source directories.
