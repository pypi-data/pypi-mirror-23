    Note: this function works with both class I and class II allele names (including

    For example, these all refer to the same MHC sequence:
        - HLA-A*02:01
        - HLA-A02:01
        - HLA-A:02:01

    variants that don't affect amino acid sequence), for our purposes these

        - A*02:01:01
        - A*02:01:01:01
    There are also suffixes which we're going to ignore:

    And lastly, for human alleles, there are serotypes which we'll treat
    as approximately equal to a 4-digit type.
        - HLA-A2
        - A2
