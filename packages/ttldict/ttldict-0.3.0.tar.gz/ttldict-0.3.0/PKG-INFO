Description: TTLDict
        =======
        
        Python dictionary with key expiry time
        
        `OrderedTTLDict` - behaves like an ordered dict you know.
        The methods `items` and `values` return a list of objects after purging expired
        objects. The method `keys` returns `odict_keys` as the parnet class, but it does
        so after purging expired keys.
        Python's own OrderedDict and other dictionaries return a [dictionary views][1]
        whereas the methods here do not.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Use pytest to run the tests:
        
        ```
        make test
        ```

        This library contains fixes for his TTLDict class
        and my own OrderedTTLDict.
        
        Without all those this work would not have been possible.
