Description: foto
        ====
        
        ``foto`` is **my personal** photo manager. I don't like tools pretending to be
        smarter than me. I like file-system based management and I couldn't find
        a folder-based manager which could do couple of simple tasks the way I want.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Only macOS and Python 3 are supported, beause that's what I currently use.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install foto
        
        Also set ``FOTO_GEOCODING_API_KEY`` in your ``~/.bash_profile``.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ git clone git@github.com:honzajavorek/foto.git
            $ cd foto
            $ cat brew_packages.txt | xargs brew install
            $ python3 -m venv env
            $ . ./env/bin/activate
            (env)$ pip install -e .
        
        Put ``.../env/bin/foto`` into your ``~/.bash_profile`` as an alias and you're done:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ echo 'alias foto=".../env/bin/foto"' >> ~/.bash_profile
