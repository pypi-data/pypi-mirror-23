SCDB Data
---------

SCDB data includes cases from 1791 term to the 2015 term. Many fields
need to be mapped to their full values. The SCDB `maintains an online
codebook <http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php>`__ with these maps.


Ideology / Qualification Scores
-------------------------------

Martin-Quinn scores measure the relative ideology of a Justice or a
Supreme Court term to the median Justice. Andrew Martin and Kevin Quinn
`wrote an excellent
paper <http://mqscores.berkeley.edu/media/pa02.pdf>`__ about the method.

Segal-Cover scores measure the ideology and qualification of an
individual Justice *before* their appointment to the Court. Jeffrey
Segal `wrote a
summary <http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/polisci/jsegal/QualTable.pdf>`__
and shows the raw data as a table (warning: PDF).
