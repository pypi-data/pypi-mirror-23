Description: awslogin
        ========
        
        Python script for CLI and SDK access to AWS via ADFS while requiring MFA
        access using https://duo.com/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        -  Install Python 3.x using your preferred method.
        -  See https://www.python.org/downloads/ for a windows installation
           method.
        -  In linux you may be able to use apt, rpm or
           https://www.python.org/downloads/.
        -  In Mac you can use homebrew, macports or
           https://www.python.org/downloads/.
        -  Run ``pip3 install byu-awslogin``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        -  Run ``awslogin`` and it will prompt you for the AWS account and role
           to use.
        -  Run ``awslogin --account <account name> --role <role name>`` to skip
           the prompting for account and name. You could specify just one of the
           arcuments as well.
        
        Deploying changes
        -----------------
        
        -  Make sure you have python 3 installed.
        -  awslogin only works with python 3.
        -  Enter your `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__
           using python 3.
        -  Install twine by running ``pip install twine``
        -  Make sure you have a '~/.pypirc' as defined
           `here <https://docs.python.org/3.2/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc>`__.
           See Paul for the login credentials.
        -  Run ``python deploy.py``
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        -  gracefully handle the error case when the duo push is rejected
        -  Add support for profiles
        -  Authenticate once for 8 hours and rerun ``awslogin`` to relogin
        -  Simplify the adfs authentication code
        -  cache netid after subsequent logins ie default to last used
        -  Write tests
        -  (David) adfs\_auth.py
        -  (Nate) index.py
        -  roles.py
        -  assume\_role.py
        -  Make a handel-codepipeline CI/CD pipeline with automated tests. If
           they pass automatically deploy to pypi.
        -  [BUG] README.md and LICENSE get left over in /usr/local when pip
           install to mac
