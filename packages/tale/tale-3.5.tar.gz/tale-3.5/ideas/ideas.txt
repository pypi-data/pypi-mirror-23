Concepts for single player Interactive Fiction mode:

------------------------------------------------------
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional picture to every MudObject description.
[feature,tkinter,html] Add optional sound clip to locations


Concepts for multiplayer MUD mode (and not really for single player I.F.):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[feature] implement IP-address based ban
[feature] global chat broadcast channel (like wow's /1) with minimum level requirement to use it (against spammers)
[feature] Write things (including crash logs) to a logfile for the server admins.
[feature] check all commands if they provide appropriate feedback to others in the room (such as "Xyz looks around")
[feature] SSH interface via Paramiko?
[feature] Let driver store player's state once in a while (every minute or so), when they logout, and when they get disconnected.
[feature] New mud-mode save command that immediately triggers the driver to store the player's state. (already exists for IF-mode)
[feature] Mailbox system: can mail messages, money and items to other players. Only when mailbox in vicinity (unless wizard). Notify player if mail arrived.
[feature] Follow other creatures: follow.  If you have a follower and want to try to stop him: evade/flee
[feature] World zones: (optional) timed zone resets to reset to starting configuration. Or global server reset? (circle has zones and zone resets)
[feature] DAMAGE TYPES:
    blunt, slash, pierce, water, shock, cold, heat, gas, acid, magic, poison, disease, sonic, psionic,
    trauma/wound, suffocation, deathray (zap-command), EMP, karma, pressure, decompression, inertia


General ideas/TODO:
-------------------
[code] Flesh out more items/templates in items.basic.  Take ideas from objects in other mudlibs
[code] adding 'a' automatically sometimes gives strange results, "you take a someone's wallet"... "you take a some cash"...
[feature] combat system.
[feature] conditional/changing/invisible exits, for instance a hatch that is not there until you 'discover' it. (circle data contains such exits?)
[feature] allow livings to wear items/armour on various body parts, extend circle zone loader to use this
    wear, put on, take off, unwear, remove <armor> | wield, unwield, remove <weapon>
[feature] allow livings to wield a single item (weapon/light/shield/...) (=always in hand), extend circle zone loader to use this
[code, API] path-finding: GOTO/GO TO <location> (must have examined it before, to remember it. See also next idea).
[code] Define a DSL to define the basic world stuff, and convert it to python source (or parse directly like the circle importers?)
[feature] Hunger/thirst/fatigue (movement/staminapoints)?
[feature] class/skill system, lockpicking skill to unlock doors without having key, ...


[feature] Light/Dark, Weather
-----------------------------
light level in rooms: dark/light? or three states?  (0=pitch black, 0.5=dark/dusk, 1=normal daylight)
darkness in locations -> can't see location/exits/items/players (unless they're fluorescent, or unless you explicitly examine <direction>?)
if there's a lightsource in the room (or someone has a light source in their inventory), the room is lit. (thus: determine light state dynamically)
Dynamic Day/night cycle?  Note that some rooms should always be lit (inside a building perhaps) so a flag for that is needed.
(Do we even want rooms to get really dark in the night time? or is darkness only for things such as caves that are permanently dark)
Circlemud has a dynamic day/night cycle and weather system. Locations marked 'indoors' are not notified of changes.
