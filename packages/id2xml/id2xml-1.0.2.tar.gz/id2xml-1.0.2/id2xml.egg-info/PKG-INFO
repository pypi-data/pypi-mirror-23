Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        Version 1.0.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal <xref/> links to
        figures and tables.
        
        The XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool, and will
        follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support is
        available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.0.2 (18 Jun 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This is a bugfix release which addressess some additional issues raised by
          the RFC Editor staff:
        
          * Set the full organization name in the author element from the 
            information in the authors' addresses section, and using what was found on 
            the first page, if different, as the abbrev attribute.
        
          * Changed the handling of quotations of RFCs with numbers below 1000 to
            always use zero-padded numbers, to match what the bibxml libraries use;
            and to insert entity references for those, instead of in-place
            <reference/> entries.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.
        
          * Changed text-table identification to not try to handle one-row tables as
            texttables.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.0.1 (14 Jun 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This is a bugfix release which addressess a number of issues raised by the
          RFC Editor staff, and a few issues found during testing.
        
          * Added generation of a sortrefs PI which matches the original's RFC
            references being sorted or not.
        
          * Tweaked the slugifier, and applied it to section-* anchors, to ensure 
            they are valid.  Fixed an issue causing trailing commas in entity names.
        
          * Rewrote the handling of back matter to permit the various back sections 
            to occur in any order.  Added yet another way to say 'work in progress' in 
            references; added new reference patterns and removed the expectation that 
            references will have a terminating period; did some minor code clean-up.
        
          * Refined the header and footer stripping to consider end-of-line commas,
            and to require short lines triggering paragraph breaks to contain text.
        
          * Fixed a bug in line reading, which could cause the first line of a 
            document to be skipped.  Added recognition of additional Standards Track 
            status indications, such as 'Proposed Standard', etc.  Fixed a grammar 
            issue.  Fixed an issue with mismatched authors on the first page and 
            Author's Addresses section.  Refined the header/footer stripping to deal 
            with additional variations of header/footer lines.
        
          * Fixed a number of places where warn() was called with a line object
            instead of the line number.
        
          * Changed to using the supplied figure or texttable label to set the 
            title attribute also when rendering the figure as texttable or texttable as 
            figure.
        
          * Refined the tokenizer for the text parser in order to correctly handle 
            things like (Section N.N).
        
          * Eliminated trailing blank cells in texttables.
        
          * Added RFC-Editor staff to the release notification list.
