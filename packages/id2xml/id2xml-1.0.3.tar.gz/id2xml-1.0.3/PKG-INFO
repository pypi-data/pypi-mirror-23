Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        Version 1.0.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal <xref/> links to
        figures and tables.
        
        The XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool, and will
        follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support is
        available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.0.3 (01 Jul 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release tweaks some regular expressions and other items to improve
          processing, based on feedback from the RFC Editor staff, but does not
          provide any new functionality.
        
          * Added recognition of series info of the form 'RFC1234' in addition to 
            the form 'RFC 12334'.  Added recognition of 'Internet Draft' on the first 
            page left column, in addition to 'Internet-Draft'.  Added some guidance to 
            the reference parsing failure message.  Added another reference pattern.
        
          * Tweaked the section number regexp.
        
          * Added acceptance of day of month in footer line date.  This improves 
            extraction of short title, too.
        
          * Be more permissive regarding blank lines in the author address format.
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.0.2 (18 Jun 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This is a bugfix release which addressess some additional issues raised by
          the RFC Editor staff:
        
          * Set the full organization name in the author element from the 
            information in the authors' addresses section, and using what was found on 
            the first page, if different, as the abbrev attribute.
        
          * Changed the handling of quotations of RFCs with numbers below 1000 to
            always use zero-padded numbers, to match what the bibxml libraries use;
            and to insert entity references for those, instead of in-place
            <reference/> entries.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.
        
          * Changed text-table identification to not try to handle one-row tables as
            texttables.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.
