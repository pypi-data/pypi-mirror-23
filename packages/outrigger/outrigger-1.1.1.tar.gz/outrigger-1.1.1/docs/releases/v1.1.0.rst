v1.1.0 (June 28th, 2017)
------------------------

This is a minor release to ```outrigger``.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `UNIQUE ID` error that happened somewhat stochastically when adding new exons to the database


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Explicitly added Python 3.6 compatibility
- Change logo location to `logo/` instead of `logo/v1` since there's only one
  version anyway...
