A tool for renaming a batch of pdf files
========================================

    MIT license, Xavier Olive 2017

The addressed use case comes the frustration caused by opening tons of
pdf files (mainly scientific publications) in order to copy-paste the
title and rename the file accordingly.

The proposed workflow goes as follow:

.. code:: sh

    $ pdfrename *.pdf
    Rename '/home/xo/Downloads/1606.04838.pdf' to '/home/xo/Downloads/Optimization Methods for Large-Scale Machine Learning.pdf'? [y/n/j/s/a] > 
    Choose among y(es)/n(o)/j(oin)/s(kip)/a(bort) > y

| The script first searches the metadata, then parses each line of the
  first page of the file to suggest it as a file name.
| Use ``j(oin)`` to merge the current suggestion with next line (for
  papers with a two-line title).
