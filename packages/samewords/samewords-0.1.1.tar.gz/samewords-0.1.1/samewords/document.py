Collection of functions for preparing LaTeX file for processing.

The main purpose is to provide the ability of identifying the relevant part of a reledmac-encoded LaTeX file and 
serve up content from each paragraph between `\beginnumbering` and `\endnumbering` for sameword processing. 

TODO: This should also be able to handle more than one section of numbered text in the document.
