Description: 
        Pylm
        ====
        
        Pylm is the Python implementation of PALM, a framework to build
        clusters of high performance components. It is presented in two
        different levels of abstraction. In the high level API you will find
        servers and clients that are functional *out of the box*. Use the high
        level API if you are interested in simple communication patterns like
        client-server, master-slave or a streaming pipeline. In the low level
        API there are a variety of small components that, once combined,
        they can be used to implement almost any kind of
        component. It's what the high level API uses under the hood. Choose
        the low level API if you are interested in creating your custom
        component and your custom communication pattern.
        
        **Pylm requires a version of Python equal or higher than 3.4, and it is
        more thoroughly tested with Python 3.5.**
        
        Installing **pylm** is as easy as:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $> pip install pylm
