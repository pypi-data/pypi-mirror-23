[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) is a multilingual package/environment manager.
It seamlessly handles non-Python library dependencies which many scientific Python tools rely upon.
Conda is reccomended, especially for Windows users.
If you don't have Python yet, start by [installing Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is a community-driven conda channel that contains smaller packages not maintained by [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview).
