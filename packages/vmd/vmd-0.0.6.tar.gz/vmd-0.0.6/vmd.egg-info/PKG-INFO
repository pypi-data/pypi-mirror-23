Summary: Terminal Markdown Viewer
========================

Render markdown in a terminal! Why? Because although Markdown is still
readable as-is, if you use Markdown a lot, it's nice to have something
to render it as you'd see as as HTML - with **bold text** and
*emphasis*, even links.

Installation
------------

Requires Python 3. Install via pip:

``$ sudo pip3 install vmd``

Note that some features of the render use Unicode (such as for link
indicies), so for now terminals that don't support Unicode (or aren't
configured to use Unicode and you don't want to change it, which is fair
enough) may experience a few issues. If this is a problem, raise an
issue or create a pull request.

Usage
-----

``$ vmd file.md``

Or via standard in:

``$ generate-markdown | vmd --stdin``

With ``less``:

``$ vmd file.md | less -rc``
