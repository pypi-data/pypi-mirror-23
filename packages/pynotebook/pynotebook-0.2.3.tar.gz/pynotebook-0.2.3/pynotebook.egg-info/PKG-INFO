        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Pynotebook is a an interactive shell for python, similar to the python
        command line but much nicer to work with. Notebooks can contain python
        code together with output and documentation. Notebooks are a pleasant
        way to develop and document python code and to store ideas.
        
        
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Most notable features are:
        
        - syntax highlighting
        - command completion (tab-key)
        - built-in graphics
        - plotting via matplotlib
        - BSD-license
        
        
        Pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except
        python and `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_. Pynotebook runs
        completely out of the box and is therefore easy to embed and
        distribute.
