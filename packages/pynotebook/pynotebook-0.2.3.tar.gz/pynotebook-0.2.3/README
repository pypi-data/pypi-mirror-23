Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a an interactive shell for python, similar to the python
command line but much nicer to work with. Notebooks can contain python
code together with output and documentation. Notebooks are a pleasant
way to develop and document python code and to store ideas.




Features
--------

Most notable features are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- built-in graphics
- plotting via matplotlib
- BSD-license


Pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except
python and `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_. Pynotebook runs
completely out of the box and is therefore easy to embed and
distribute.



Installation:
-------------

Do in a console:

:: 

  python ./setup.py build

and then as root:

::

  python ./setup.py install

This will install the pynb application and the pynotebook module.
