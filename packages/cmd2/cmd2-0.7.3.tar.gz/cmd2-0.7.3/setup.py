VERSION = '0.7.3'
DESCRIPTION = "Extra features for standard library's cmd module"

LONG_DESCRIPTION = """cmd2 is an enhancement to the standard library's cmd module for Python 2.7
and Python 3.3+.   It is pure Python code with dependencies only on the six and pyparsing modules.

The latest documentation for cmd2 can be read online here:
https://cmd2.readthedocs.io/

Drop-in replacement adds several features for command-prompt tools:

    * Searchable command history (commands: "hi", "li", "run")
    * Load commands from file, save to file, edit commands in file
    * Multi-line commands
    * Case-insensitive commands
    * Special-character shortcut commands (beyond cmd's "@" and "!")
    * Settable environment parameters
    * Parsing commands with flags
    * > (filename), >> (filename) redirect output to file
    * < (filename) gets input from file
    * bare >, >>, < redirect to/from paste buffer
    * accepts abbreviated commands when unambiguous
    * `py` enters interactive Python console
    * test apps against sample session transcript (see examples/example.py)

Usable without modification anywhere cmd is used; simply import cmd2.Cmd in place of cmd.Cmd.
