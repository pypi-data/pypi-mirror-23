Description: 
        `transformpy` is a Python 2/3 module for doing transforms on "streams" of data.
        The transforms can be applied to any python iterable object, and so can be used
        for continuous real_time streams or static streams (such as from a file). It
        is designed in such a manner that it uses very little memory (unless necessary
        by clustering and/or aggregation routines). It was originally designed to
        allow python transformations (maps and reductions) of data stored within HIVE,
        using the Hadoop streaming paradigm.
        
        **NOTE:** TransformPy is *not* guaranteed to be API stable before version 1.0;
        but changes should be small if any to the current version.
