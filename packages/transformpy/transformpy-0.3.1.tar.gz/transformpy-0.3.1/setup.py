`transformpy` is a Python 2/3 module for doing transforms on "streams" of data.
The transforms can be applied to any python iterable object, and so can be used
for continuous real_time streams or static streams (such as from a file). It
is designed in such a manner that it uses very little memory (unless necessary
by clustering and/or aggregation routines). It was originally designed to
allow python transformations (maps and reductions) of data stored within HIVE,
using the Hadoop streaming paradigm.

**NOTE:** TransformPy is *not* guaranteed to be API stable before version 1.0;
but changes should be small if any to the current version.
