Description: #TbaApi3
        TbaApi3 is a Python library for TheBlueAlliance.com's API version 3. It's currently in development, but right now supports all Team and requests. 
        
        #Installation
        To install TbaApi3 with pip:  
        ```pip install TbaApi3```
        In addition to having the library installed, you'll need an API Key from TBA. You can find one [here](https://www.thebluealliance.com/account).
        
        #Usage
        To create an ApiObject with new key `'key'`:
        ```
        import TbaApi3
        
        api_object = TbaApi3.ApiObject('key')
        ```
        Now you can check documentation to find corresponding TBA API calls and their functions, as well as a few extra "convenience" functions. For example, to find all FRC teams active in a season:
        ```
        teams = api_object.get_all_teams(year)
        ```
        Now to get the name of the first team:
        ```
        print(teams[0].nickname)
        ```
