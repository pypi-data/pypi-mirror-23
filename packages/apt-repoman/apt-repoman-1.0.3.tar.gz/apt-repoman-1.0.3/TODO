* in general the code is way less of a mess than the original circa-2011
  hacked-together-in-a-weekend version, but there's still a lot of
  room for improvement: lots of overly complicated functions that
  could stand decomposition

* test coverage could be...much better

* probably still lots of room for optimization on the publish process;
  currently writing out 2 distributions + 3 components to S3 takes about
  30 seconds

* docstrings, pydoc, pylint...
