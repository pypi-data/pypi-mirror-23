Purpose
=======

Generic configuration library for any app.

Pretty much a Flask config-like object with added functionality based on flask-appconfig.

This is currently a quick hack. Don't judge me.

TODO
----

- Move to explicit usage that accept either files or strings, *not* both.
- Documentation
- Import work using chainmaps
