Description: Blister
        =======
        
        An import hook for Python 2.7 that minimizes the amount of disk access.
        There will be no change in functionality or feature when the import hook
        is installed, applications run over the network have reduced startup by
        **45 seconds**!
        
        Applications like
        [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) and
        [Sidefx Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/) have Python deeply embedded.
        Studios will deploy many custom and third party modules
        in these environments. This can lead to over 60 entries in the `sys.path`,
        which is not a situation the native Python importer is equipped to deal with.
        
        The software is distributed under the MIT open source license.
        
        How To
        ------
        
        Get the `blister.py` module onto your `$PYTHONPATH`, or use
        a package manager like `pip install blister`. You'll also want to edit
        or create a `sitecustomize.py` module with code that looks like this:
        
        ```
        import blister
        blister.install()
        ```
        
        Results
        -------
        
        A test script was created that imports several large dependencies.
        This operation creates 479 new modules into `sys.modules`. On Linux, using
        `strace -e trace=file` this generates 13,619 file operations. By inventing
        a new unit, disk operations per module, the vanilla Python interpreter runs
        at an abusive 28.4 DOPM.
        
        By installing the import hook, this is reduced to 4,139 operations, giving
        8.6 DOPM.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        So what does this mean for actual performance? These results from several
        environments should give you an idea of what to expect.
        
        ### Linux on network nfs drive
        
        The performance gained for the cold cache on the network drive is a big
        success. In this case the cold cache time are actually faster coming over
        the network than on a local spinning disk.
        
        |                     | Hot Cache | Cold Cache |
        |---------------------|-----------|------------|
        | Vanilla Python 2.7  | 0.70 sec  | 7.89 sec   |
        | Blister import hook | 0.65 sec  | 2.71 sec   |
        
        ### Linux on local hard disk
        
        It appears cutting thousands of file operations has no affect on performance.
        The cold cache timing likely has too much fluxuation to gather any results.
        This is on a traditional spinning platters drive, not SSD.
        
        |                     | Hot Cache | Cold Cache |
        |---------------------|-----------|------------|
        | Vanilla Python 2.7  | 0.43 sec  | 9.21 sec   |
        | Blister import hook | 0.43 sec  | 9.97 sec   |
        
        ### Windows on local drive
        
        Windows does a good job with the cold cache. It seemed odd that the less
        file operations resulted in slightly slower times. I expect windows cold
        cache timings are subject to fluxuations. Blister gives a moderate
        performance bump for the hot cache imports.
        
        |                     | Hot Cache | Cold Cache |
        |---------------------|-----------|------------|
        | Vanilla Python 2.7  | 1.37 sec  | 2.15 sec   |
        | Blister import hook | 0.99 sec  | 2.37 sec   |
        
        ### Windows on network drive
        
        This network drive was both twice as fast for the cold and warm cache tests
        on Windows.
        
        |                     | Hot Cache | Cold Cache |
        |---------------------|-----------|------------|
        | Vanilla Python 2.7  | 6.63 sec  | 8.92 sec   |
        | Blister import hook | 3.95 sec  | 5.12 sec   |
