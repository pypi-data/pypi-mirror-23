linux-utils: Linux system administration tools for Python

The Python package `linux-utils` provides utility functions that make it easy
to script system administration tasks on Linux_ systems in Python. At the
moment only parsing of the ``/etc/fstab`` and ``/etc/crypttab`` configuration
files is implemented, but more functionality will soon be released. The package
is currently tested on cPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy (2.7).

Installation
------------

The `linux-utils` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation should
be as simple as:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install linux-utils

There's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per
user site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing
system wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so
if this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these
instructions ;-).

Usage
-----

Please refer to the API documentation available on `Read the Docs`_.

History
-------

Back in 2015 I wrote some Python code to parse the Linux configuration files
``/etc/fstab`` and ``/etc/crypttab`` for use in crypto-drive-manager_. Fast
forward to 2017 and I found myself wanting to use the same functionality
in rsync-system-backup_. Three options presented themselves to me:

1. **Copy/paste the relevant code.** Having to maintain the same code in
   multiple places causes lower quality code because having to duplicate the
   effort of writing documentation, developing tests and fixing bugs is a very
   demotivating endeavor.

   In fact sometime in 2016 I *did* copy/paste parts of this code into a
   project at work, because I needed similar functionality there. Of course
   since then the two implementations have started diverging :-p.

2. **Make crypto-drive-manager a dependency of rsync-system-backup.** Although
   this approach is less ugly than copy/pasting the code, it still isn't
   exactly elegant because the two projects have nothing to do with each other
   apart from working with LUKS encrypted disks on Linux.

3. **Extract the functionality into a new package.** In my opinion this is
   clearly the most elegant approach, unfortunately it also requires the most
   work from me :-). On the plus side I'm publishing the new package with a
   test suite which means less untested code remains in crypto-drive-manager_
   (which doesn't have a test suite at the time of writing).

While extracting the code I shortly considered integrating the functionality
into debuntu-tools_, however the ``/etc/fstab`` and ``/etc/crypttab`` parsing
isn't specific to Debian or Ubuntu at all and debuntu-tools_ has several
dependencies that aren't relevant to Linux configuration file parsing.

Tangentially related: The reason I went with the extremely generic name
`linux-utils` is because I will be adding more *"specific to Linux but not
Debian"* functionality to this package in the very near future :-).
