Description: 
        ============
         ECX Client
        ============
        
        This project aims to build a Python client for Catalogic Software's 
        `ECX <https://catalogicsoftware.com/products/ecx/>`_ product. 
        
        This repo holds two components. 
        
        - An SDK that can be used by anyone interested in integrating ECX
          operations in their workflow.
        
        - A command line utility with which ECX operations can be performed.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
        $ pip install ecxclient
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            $ ecxcli --help
            
            # This connects to ECX on localhost.
            $ ecxcli --user admin --passwd <PASSWORD> job list
            
            # To connect to a different host. Default user is "admin".
            $ ecxcli --url https://1.2.3.4:8443 --passwd <PASSWORD> job list
            
        Notes
        =====
        
        - After a successful login, the command "remembers" the login session
          so there is no need to pass user name and password with every
          run.
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        - When "https" URL is used, there are some warnings displayed on the
          console. We need to find a way to get rid of them.
