The original paper describing Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) can be
found here:

Essentially, CSA is like multiple simulated annealing (i.e. ``m``
independent SA processes run in parallel), except that the acceptance
probability at each step is calculated as a function of the current
state across *all* ``m`` processes. For a more complete description of
the general CSA algorithm, see `Description of
CSA <#description-of-csa>`__ below.

Description of CSA
------------------

Suppose we are trying optimize (meaning minimize, in this case) some
function ``my_function()`` which takes ``x`` as input and outputs a
float.

We are going to run ``m`` processes in parallel. Therefore ``x_i`` will
denote the current solution for the ``m``\ th process.

Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before describing the algorithm, we will need to define the following
functions and parameters:

-  ``energy_func(tac, ...)`` is a function which takes ``tac`` (the
   acceptance "temperature") and the quantities
   ``my_function(x_1), ..., my_function(x_m)`` as input and outputs a
   float. That is, ``energy_func`` represents the "energy" of the
   current solution set ``x_1, ..., x_m``.
-  ``generation_schedule(tgen, iteration)`` is a function which takes
   ``tgen`` (the generation "temperature") and the number of the current
   iteration as input. The ``generation_schedule`` function determines
   how much ``tgen`` is decreased at each iteration. A typical choice
   for ``generation_schedule`` is just to multiply the current value of
   ``tgen`` by 0.9999.
-  ``default_tgen`` is the initial value given to ``tgen``.
-  ``acceptance_schedule(tac, iteration)`` is a function which takes
   ``tac`` (the acceptance "temperature") and the number of the current
   iteration as input. This function determines how much ``tac`` will be
   decreased at each iteration. A typical choice for
   ``acceptance_schedule`` is just to multiply ``tac`` by 0.99.
-  ``default_tac`` is the initial value given to ``tac``.
-  ``random_probe(i, tgen)`` is a function which produces a random value
   for each ``x_i`` according to some distribution which depends on
   ``tgen``.
-  ``acceptance_prob(tac, current_state, x_i, y_i)`` is a function that
   outputs a number between 0 and 1.
-  ``n`` the number of inner iterations (how many times we repeat steps
   2 and 3 over each overall iteration).
-  ``N`` the number of outer iterations.

    NOTE: The choices for ``energy_func()``, ``generation_schedule()``,
    ``acceptance_schedule()``, and ``random_probe()`` are what
    distinguish the particular classes of CSA algorithms.

The algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Initialization**

-  Assign random initial solutions to ``x_1``, ..., ``x_m``.
-  Let ``gamma = energy_func(my_function(x_1), ..., my_function(x_m))``.
-  Set ``tgen = default_tgen``.
-  Set ``tac = default_tac``.
-  Set the inner iteration index ``j = 0``.
-  Set the outer iteration index ``k = 0``.

2. **Generation**

-  For each ``i in (1, ..., m)``:

   -  Generate a "probing" solution ``y_i = x_i + e``, where ``e`` is
      randomly generated from the function ``random_probe(i, tgen)``.

3. **Acceptance**

-  For each ``i in (1, ..., m)``:

   -  If ``my_function(y_i) < my_function(x_i)``, set ``x_i = y_i``.
   -  Else, set ``p = acceptance_prob(gamma, x_i, y_i)``. Then sample
      ``r`` from a uniform(0, 1) distribution and set ``x_i = y_i`` if
      ``r < p``, otherwise keep ``x_i = x_i``.

-  Now update
   ``gamma = energy_func(my_function(x_1), ..., my_function(x_m))``.
-  Increment ``j += 1``.
-  If ``j < n``, go back to step 2, otherwise set ``j = 0`` and continue
   to step 4.

4. **Cooling**

-  Decrease the "temperatures" ``tgen`` and ``tac`` according to their
   respective schedules, i.e. we set
   ``tgen = generation_schedule(tgen, k)`` and
   ``tac = acceptance_schedule(tac, k)``.
-  Increment ``k += 1``.

5. **Stop**

-  Stop if the stopping criteria is met or if ``k >= N``. Otherwise
   return to step 2.
