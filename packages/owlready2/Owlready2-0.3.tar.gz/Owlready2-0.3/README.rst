Owlready2
=========

Owlready2 is a module for ontology-oriented programming in Python 3, including an optimized RDF quadstore.

Owlready2 can:

 - Import OWL 2.0 ontologies in NTriples, RDF/XML or OWL/XML format.

 - Export OWL 2.0 ontologies to NTriples or RDF/XML.

 - Manipulates ontology classes, instances and properties transparently,
   as if they were normal Python objects.

 - Add Python methods to ontology classes.

 - Perform automatic classification of classes and instances, using the HermiT reasoner.

 - In addition, the quadstore is compatible with the RDFlib Pyton module, which can be used to perform SPARQL queries.
   
Owlready has been created by Jean-Baptiste Lamy at the LIMICS reseach lab.
It is available under the GNU LGPL licence v3.

What can I do with Owlready2?
-----------------------------

Load an ontology from a local repository, or from Internet:

::

  >>> from owlready2 import *
  >>> onto_path.append("/path/to/your/local/ontology/repository")
  >>> onto = get_ontology("http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/_downloads/pizza_onto.owl")
  >>> onto.load()

Create new classes in the ontology, possibly mixing OWL constructs and Python methods:

::

  >>> class NonVegetarianPizza(onto.Pizza):
  ...   equivalent_to = [
  ...     onto.Pizza
  ...   & ( onto.has_topping.some(onto.MeatTopping)
  ...     | onto.has_topping.some(onto.FishTopping)
  ...     ) ]
  ...   def eat(self): print("Beurk! I'm vegetarian!")

Access ontology class, and create new instances / individuals:

::

  >>> onto.Pizza
  pizza_onto.Pizza
  >>> test_pizza = onto.Pizza("test_pizza_owl_identifier")
  >>> test_pizza.has_topping = [ onto.CheeseTopping(),
  ...                            onto.TomatoTopping(),
  ...                            onto.MeatTopping  () ]

Export to RDF/XML file:

::

  >>> test_onto.save()

Perform reasoning, and classify instances and classes:

::

   >>> test_pizza.__class__
   onto.Pizza
   
   >>> # Execute HermiT and reparent instances and classes
   >>> sync_reasoner()
   
   >>> test_pizza.__class__
   onto.NonVegetarianPizza
   >>> test_pizza.eat()
   Beurk! I'm vegetarian !
