Description: The objective of this project is to create a configuration independent configuration module, easy to use, and that you
        know it is easy to add a new backend.
        
        There is a lot of cool stuff pending to be done, and will try to populate issues/TODOs but it's way too much. Feel free
        to submit PRs with whatever you want. I will then accept them if they work etc.
