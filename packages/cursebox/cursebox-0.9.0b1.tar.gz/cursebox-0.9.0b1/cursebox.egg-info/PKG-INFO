Description: # Cursebox
        
        _Make Squeezeboxes great again!_
        
        
        ## Motivation
        
        The year is 2017, and time is ripe for a terminal interface for controlling the
        excellent, but unfortunately discontinued, range of Squeezeboxes by Logitech
        (and before that, Slimdevices).
        
        Despite the fact that
        [the product line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_(network_music_player))
        was officially killed by Logitech in 2012, the ecosystem still lives on,
        stronger than ever. Various soft- and hardware projects for the ecosystem are
        actively being developed, which truly emphasises the beauty and brilliance of
        both the Squeezebox/LMS ecosystem in particular, and open source in general.
        
        These days, software Squeezeboxes run on virtually any hardware available
        capable of playing audio. Various programs and apps for easy control of
        Squeezeboxes exist for almost any platform you can think of... Except for one
        important but neglected platform: **The terminal**.
        
        In October 2016, the **Cursebox** team set out on a mission to correct this
        neglect and provide the terminal interface for Squeezeboxes we have all needed
        for so many years.
        
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        **Cursebox** is an interactive utility that allows you to control your
        Squeezeboxes from the terminal. Building on top of the telnet interface
        provided by the Logitech Media Server, **Cursebox** makes searching, playing
        and queueing music from your library a breeze. Playing your favorite songs is
        only a few keystrokes away, thanks to the intuitive keyboard-only navigation
        provided by **Cursebox**.
        
        Simply launch **Cursebox**, type `sa` to **s**earch for an **a**lbum, then type
        the first letters of the name of an album, `Tab` through the find-as-you-type
        search results until the right album is highligted, press `Enter`, press `p`
        and the album instantly starts **p**laying on your Squeezebox. All this can be
        done in a matter of seconds. No more having to navigate to the web interface of
        LMS to find your music by clicking around. Never again will you have the need
        to find your Squeezebox control app of choice on your smartphone and tap
        through menus and options.
        
        Do you want to change the volume level? Type `v` and then use familiar `j`/`k`
        keys to de- and increase the volume level. Or simply press any number to change
        the volume level to any multiple of 10%.
        
        Pressing `space` toggles play/pause, and `p` gives you access to your current
        playlist, in case you want to skip to another track.
        
        It's all there at your fingertips, a few keystrokes away, right at home,
        in the terminal.
        
        
        ### Features
        
         * Now playing overview.
         * Play/pause.
         * Navigate current playlist.
         * De- and increase volume level.
         * Select which player to control.
         * Search for music (artists, albums, tracks).
         * Queue or play items.
         * List favorites.
         * List new music.
        
        
        ## The future
        
        Currently, **Cursebox** has a basic set of features. There are still lots of
        missing features that would be nice to implement. But things take time, and the
        **Cursebox** team decided to release early, with support for the most often
        used features, rather than keeping this fundamentally useful utility in the
        dark for ourselves.
        
        We have a daunting journey ahead of us, implementing further features. But we
        also have the guts to take on the responsibility and turn our (and your) dreams
        into reality.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        **Cursebox** requires nothing but Python 3 on your system.
        
        
        ## Installation and basic usage
        
        Clone the repository to a location of your own choice. Then run the
        `cursebox.py` script to see your options:
        
        ```
        Usage: cursebox [OPTIONS] [ARG]
        Squeezebox and music library control. Make Squeezeboxes great again!
        
        OPTIONS
        
        The following options are recognised:
        
          -c, --config          Path to configuration file. Optional. Default location
                                is ~/.cursebox.conf
          -s, --server          Hostname of the LMS server to connect to.
          -p, --port            Port of the LMS server to connect to. Optional,
                                defaults to 9090.
          -u  --username        Username used for authentication with LMS. Optional.
          -P  --password        Password used for authentication with LMS. Optional.
          -b, --player_id       ID (MAC address) of the Squeezebox to connect to.
          -h, --help            Show this help message. Obviously optional.
        
        ARGUMENT(S)
        
        Only a single argument (or none at all) is allowed. Can be one of
        the following:
        
          create-config         Create a new default configuration file in
                                ~/.cursebox.conf (if it doesn't already exist).
        
        Prodiving no arguments will simply launch Cursebox.
        ```
        
        It is strongly advised to create a configuration file with your static settings
        and, optionally, an `alias` that will run the script with the correct options
        for you if any of these are dynamic (e.g. `player_id` based on your location)
        or secret (e.g. `password`), to make everything even more smooth and easy.
