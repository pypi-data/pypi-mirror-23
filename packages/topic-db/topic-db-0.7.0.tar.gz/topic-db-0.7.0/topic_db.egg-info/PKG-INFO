Description: TopicDB from StoryTechnologies
        ==============================
        
        TopicDB is a topic map-based graph library (using `PostgreSQL`_ for persistence).
        
        .. image:: http://www.storytechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/topic-db-logo.png
        
        For a more in-depth introduction to topic maps, I recommend reading the excellent introductory
        article on topic maps over at MSDN: `An Introduction to Topic Maps`_. With that being said, although
        TopicDB is inspired by the topic maps paradigm, it is not (and never will be) an implementation of
        the `ISO/IEC 13250 Topic Maps`_ data model standard.
        
        TopicDB is intended to be used by other Python applications, and currently does not provide a web
        interface to the API. `Story Engine`_ is a good example of TopicDB being used by another
        application.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I build (story) worlds. TopicDB plays a crucial role in that endeavour: `Interactive Scene Browser for Stories`_.

            $ pip install topic-db
        
        First-Time Use
        --------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from topicdb.core.store.topicstore import TopicStore
            from topicdb.core.store.retrievaloption import RetrievalOption
        
            from topicdb.core.models.topic import Topic
            from topicdb.core.models.language import Language
        
            TOPIC_MAP_IDENTIFIER = 1
        
            # Instantiate and open topic store.
            store = TopicStore("localhost", "username", "password")
            store.open()
        
            # Create the topic map and bootstrap default topics.
            store.set_topic_map(TOPIC_MAP_IDENTIFIER, "Topic Map Test")
        
            topic1 = Topic(identifier='test-topic1',
                           base_name='Tópico de Prueba',
                           language=Language.SPA)
        
            # Persist topic to store.
            if not store.topic_exists(TOPIC_MAP_IDENTIFIER, 'test-topic1'):
                store.set_topic(TOPIC_MAP_IDENTIFIER, topic1)
        
            # Retrieve topic from store (with the accompanying topic attributes).
            topic2 = store.get_topic(TOPIC_MAP_IDENTIFIER, 'test-topic1',
                                     resolve_attributes=RetrievalOption.RESOLVE_ATTRIBUTES)
        
            store.close()
