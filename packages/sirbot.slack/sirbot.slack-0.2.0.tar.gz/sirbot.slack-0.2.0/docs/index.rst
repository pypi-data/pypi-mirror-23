Welcome to sirbot-slack documentation!

Sirbot-slack is a slack plugin for `Sir-bot-a-lot`_. It aims to provide full
support for the slack API (Web, Events and RTM).

The uses of bots are nearly endless and come in all shapes and sizes.
They can handle Slack shenanigans, monitor the status of a crypto-currency,
or become your personal assistant. Sir-bot-a-lot can help you get started
writing your own.
