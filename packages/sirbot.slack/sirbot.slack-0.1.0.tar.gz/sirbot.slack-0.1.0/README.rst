Sirbot-slack is a slack plugin for `Sir Bot-a-lot`_. It aims to provide full
support for the slack API (Web, Events and RTM).

The uses of bots are nearly endless and come in all shapes and sizes. They can
handle Slack shenanigans, monitor the status of a crypto-currency, or become
your personal assistant. Sir-bot-a-lot can help you get started writing your
own.

Sir-bot-a-lot and sirbot-slack are projects maintained by the `pyslackers`_
