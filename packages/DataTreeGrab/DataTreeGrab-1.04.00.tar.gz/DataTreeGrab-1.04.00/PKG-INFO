Description: 
        This Package contains a tool for extracting structured data from HTML and JSON
        pages.
        It reads the page into a Node based tree, from which you, on the bases of a json
        data-file, can extract your data into a list of items. It can first extract a
        list of keyNodes and extract for each of them the same data-list. During the
        extraction several data manipulation functions are available.
        
        Main advantages
         - It gives you a highly dependable dataset from a potentially changable source.
         - You can easily update on changes in the source without touching your code.
         - You can make the data_def available on a central location while distributing
           the aplication and so giving your users easy access to (automated) updates.
