Description: 
        The intervalTree class is an adaptation of the interval tree algorithm based on
        red-black trees from Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest
        and Stein (2001) 2nd Edition, The MIT Press
        
        This makes a nice self-balancing tree.  The alrogithm may be more efficient
        if items are randomly selected for insertion, instead of in sort order.
        
        I've modified the CLRS algorithm to report all overlapping nodes instead of
        only the first node.  This involved adding a min value instead of only a max
        value in order to speed up the search by checking if the subtree min,max
        overlaps with the search interval.  The search routine is also recursive.
