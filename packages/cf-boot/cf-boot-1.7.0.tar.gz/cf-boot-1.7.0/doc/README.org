#+TITLE: cf-boot

*cf-boot* provides a declarative mechanism for bootstrapping
   cloudfoundry products.\\
The project provides a cleaner and more robust alternative to long, complex, monolithic
bootstrap scripts, by decoupling the ~how~ and ~what~
  components of bootstrapping.

* Quick Start
** Installation
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ sudo -E pip install cf-boot
   $ cf-boot -h
    usage: cf-boot [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-f] [-p PATH]
                   [-g DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_PDF] [-v VERBOSE] [-s]
                   project-spec
    ...
   #+END_SRC

   Or from the source tree:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ git clone https://github.build.ge.com/hubs/cf-boot
   $ cd cf-boot
   $ sudo python setup.py install
   #+END_SRC


** Usage
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ cf-boot ui-app-hub-boot.json -i envs/hubs-poc.json -o hubs-poc-results.json

* Overview
** cf-boot components
   - *project spec* (~what~)
     - User-provided specification of the bootstrap requirements:
       A JSON DSL specifying a set of ~jobs~,
       each of which specifies
       - the script to execute it
       - the inputs to the script
       - the outputs to capture from the script
       Outputs from one job can be passed as inputs to another job
     - *free variables* (~what~)
       - environment-specific values or sensitive values such as passwords
         or other credentials, which are decoupled from the project spec
   - *subscripts* (~how~)
     - Executable, reusable scripts that are invoked
       by the master script to carry out a job
       specified in the user's project spec.
   - *master script* (~what~ + ~how~)
     - project-spec parsing and execution engine, organizing jobs by dependency,
       piping job inputs and outputs, producing final JSON key-value map\\
       The master script links the ~what~ and the ~how~

** Benefits
   - Decoupling of ~how~ and ~what~ allows users to bootstrap
     their products declaratively instead of writting code
   - Arbitrary chaining of jobs and the data they produce
   - Automatic dependency management based on inputs/outputs
   - Decoupling of environment-specific values, credentials, passwords from the
     project spec
     - Allows project spec to be published and serve as bootstrap documentation
     - Allows project spec to remain stable across environments
   - Flexibility to allow user to provide custom subscripts
     to meet highly product-specific bootstrap needs
   - Idempotence as a way to cleanly address the need to update,
   - Idempotence as a way to handle or clean up undefined or undesirable state




* <<project-spec>> Project Spec specification
  The project spec is a JSON document
** Jobs
   A job is a JSON map with 3 required fields, *script*, *input*, *output*, and optionally a *description*
   #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border
   | *field name* | *field type*            | *field description*                                                                                                                            | *example*                                                                                     |
   | script       | string                  | the name of the sub-script to carry out the job                                                                                                | "create-uaa-service"                                                                          |
   | output       | map of string -> string | keys much match sub-script output names. values are the names that other jobs may refer to.                                                    | {"service_guid":"uaa_service_guid", "client_secret":"uaa_client_secret", "uaa_uri":"uaa_uri"} |
   | input        | map of string -> JSON   | keys must match sub-script input names. values may be any JSON object. nested strings starting with ~$~ are substituted with their known value | {"uaa_uri":"$uaa_uri", "uaa_client_secret":"$uaa_client_secret", "acs_zone":"$acs_zone"}      |
   | description  | string                  | optional description of the job                                                                                                                | "uaa service for config manager"                                                              |
** Spec file
   A spec file is a JSON mapping "jobs" to a list of jobs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
    {
       "jobs": [
    ...
          {
             "script": "create-unique-cf-home",
             "description": "unique cf login for all sub-scripts that must use cf commands",
             "input": {

                "CF_USER": "$CF_USER",
                "CF_PASSWORD": "$CF_PASSWORD",
                "CF_ORG": "$CF_ORG",
                "CF_SPACE": "$CF_SPACE"
             },
             "output": {
                "CF_HOME": "CF_HOME"
             }
          },
          {
             "script": "create-service",
             "description": "create config manager postgres instance",
             "input": {
                "instance_name": "$postgres_instance_name",
                "service": "postgres",
                "plan": "shared-nr",
                "cf_home": "$CF_HOME"
             },
             "output": {
                "SERVICE_GUID": "postgres_service_guid"
             }
          },
          {
             "script": "extract-service-credentials",
     	     "description": "obtain jdbc uri of config manager postgres instance",
             "input": {
                 "app_guid": "$postgres-bootstrapper-guid",
                 "cf_home": "$CF_HOME",
                 "service_instance_guid": "$postgres_service_guid",
     	         "credential_paths": {"jdbc_uri" : ["jdbc_uri"]}
              },
              "output": {
                 "jdbc_uri": "config_manager_jdbc_uri"
              }
           }

          ...
        ]
    }
   #+END_SRC
   - In the first job
     - ~$CF_TARGET~, ~$CF_USER~, ~$CF_PASSWORD~, ~$CF_ORG~, ~$CF_SPACE~ are free variables since they are not produced by any other job.
     - ~create-unique-cf-home~ script outputs a variable ~CF_HOME~, which we capture internally as ~CF_HOME~
   - The second job
     - refers to the ~$CF_HOME~ produced by the first job
     - Its script outputs a variable ~SERVICE_GUID~,
       which we capture internally as ~postgres_service_guid~
   - The third job uses ~postgres-service-guid~ from the second job, as
     well as ~CF_HOME~ from the first job, and produces ~config_manager_jdbc_uri~

   A project spec is malformed if it contains two jobs which output the same
   variable

** Job execution order
   The master script automatically determines job order based on variable dependencies. If
   - Job *A* outputs *X* and
   - Job *B* refers to *$X*, then
   - Job *A* must run before Job *B*

   This implies no job can depend on a job that produces no outputs.
   For such cases, a job may produce a dummy indicator variable that can be refered by any dependent jobs.\\

   A project spec is malformed if it contains cyclic job dependencies
* Subscripts
** Built-in subscripts
   The following subscripts are provided by default as basic cf bootstrapping
   building blocks:

   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/create-unique-cf-home][create-unique-cf-home]]
     - Allows other subscripts to call cf commands against a
       particular environment safely
     - Allow jobs to target different environments simultaneously without
       conflict
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/create-service][create-service]],
     - create or update a service service
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/cf-cups][cf-cups]]
     - create or update a user-provided service service
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/extract-service-credentials][extract-service-credentials]]
     - extract one or more credentials from an existing service based on their
       path within the credentials' JSON map
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/cf-push-app][cf-push-app]]
     - push a reference app, diagnostic app, or environment-administrative app
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/create-uaa-clients][create-uaa-clients]]
     - create or update clients on a uaa server
   - [[file:cfboot/scripts/create-acs-policy][create-acs-policy]]
     - create or update an acs policy

** Creating a new sub-script
   A subscript is any executable file NAME.EXT that conforms to the following requirements:
    - Is executable
    - Lives under ~NAME/NAME.EXT~ somewhere on the subscripts *path*
    - Read all its input from stdin JSON
    - Output all data as a JSON key-value pairs
      - May display progress/debug logs to stderr
    - Must be idempotent. Running the script multiple times should be equivalent to running it once
      - Most of the cf api, as well as cf commands already have this property

   Sub-scripts should also observe the following guidelines
    - Have small and clearly defined scope and meaningful name
    - Be self-contained and not interfere with OS user or other processes
      - Any scripts running CF commands must explicitly set the CF_HOME environment variable
      - Should not use uaac until CF_HOME-like support is added

   Pull requests are welcome for subscripts which meet the above guidelines
   and provide functionality not already covered
** Adding custom subscripts to the cf-boot path
   Use the ~--path~ flag to specify the custom subscript's directory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ cf-boot -h
   ...
  -p PATH, --path PATH  colon-delimited path where to find additional
                         subscripts
   $ cf-boot ui-app-hub-bootstrap.json --path /path/to/my/own/subscripts --input envs/hubs-poc.json
   ...
   #+END_SRC
** Subscript environment variables, proxies
   The master script's environment variables are passed onto its children subscripts, including https_proxy.\\
   It is up to the subscripts to either use or override these variables.
