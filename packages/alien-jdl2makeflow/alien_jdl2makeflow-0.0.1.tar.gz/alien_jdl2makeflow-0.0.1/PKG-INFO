Description: jdl2makeflow
        ============
        
        Run [AliEn](http://alien.web.cern.ch) JDLs on multiple platforms using
        [Makeflow](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/makeflow).
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        [Makeflow](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/makeflow) needs to be installed on
        your system. Makeflow is part of the Cooperative Computing tools (cctools). To
        install it, [download the latest
        version of cctools](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/downloadfiles.php) then
        unpack, compile and install it (we are assuming 6.1.1 is the latest, check the
        download page first):
        
            cd /tmp
            curl -L http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/files/cctools-6.1.1-source.tar.gz | tar xzf -
            cd cctools-*-source/
            ./configure && make -j10
            sudo make install
        
        Run the last command (`make install`) *as root* to install it system-wide.
        Adjust `-j10` to the number of parallel cores you want to use during the build.
        If you do not have root privileges:
        
            cd /tmp
            curl -L http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/files/cctools-6.1.1-source.tar.gz | tar xzf -
            cd cctools-*-source/
            ./configure --prefix=$HOME/cctools && make -j10 && make install
            echo 'export PATH=$HOME/cctools/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/cctools/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
        
        We are installing under `~/cctools` but you can use the directory you want.
        Also, we are assuming your shell configuration file is `~/.bashrc`, adjust it
        according to your shell.
        
        
        Get jdl2makeflow
        ----------------
        
        As easy as:
        
            sudo pip install alien_jdl2makeflow
        
        If you cannot install it as root, you will probably have to export some Python
        variables to make it work. If you have a user installation of some Python
        distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) this is
        probably already done for you.
