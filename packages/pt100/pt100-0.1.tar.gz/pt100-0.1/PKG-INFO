Description: pt100
        =====
        
        Python package with different calculation algorithms for Pt100
        temperature sensors.
        
        This package was written to facilitate converting Pt100 sensor
        resistance values to temperature values and back. Different algorithms
        (e.g. lookup tables) and approximating polygonal functions are described
        in literature and in different sites on the Internet. A further aim of
        this package is to make it easy to choose the right approximation or
        algorithm.
