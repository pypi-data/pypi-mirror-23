fspath: Semantic path names and much more.

After 10 years juggling with os.path, zipfile & Co. I thought it is time to
bring back more *pythonic* to APIs. fspath is made with the philosophy that
API's should be intuitive and their defaults should at least cover 80% of what a
programmer daily needs.  Started with the semantic file system path, it grows
continuous and includes more and more handy stuff for the daily python
scripting.
