==================
PyRabbit2
==================

This project is fork module to communicate the RabbitMQ HTTP Management API https://github.com/bkjones/pyrabbit

Pyrabbit is a module to make it easy to interface w/ RabbitMQ's HTTP Management
API.  It's tested against RabbitMQ 3.6.10 using Python 2.7-3.6. It has
a pretty solid set of tests, and I use tox to test across Python versions.

PyRabbit is on PyPI, which makes it installable using pip or easy_install.

See the documentation at http://pyrabbit.readthedocs.org

Please send pull requests! Pyrabbit doesn't yet provide 100% coverage of
the exposed RabbitMQ API, so dig in!
