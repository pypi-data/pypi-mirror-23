Description: journalwatch
        ============
        
        journalwatch is a tool which can find error messages in the systemd
        journal.
        
        It is similiar to tools like `logwatch <http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/>`_
        or `logcheck <http://logcheck.org/>`_ except it's much more KISS and only works
        with the systemd `journal <http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html>`_.
        It works by defining patterns to match all log lines which are not interesting,
        and then prints all log lines not matching those patterns (or sends them by
        mail).
        
        When you start it the first time, it'll write the default pattern and
        config to ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/journalwatch`` (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is
        ``$HOME/.config`` if unset). Details on how to configure journalwatch
        are available in these files.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3 (mainly tested with 3.5, should work with >= 3.3)
        -  ``systemd`` python module
        -  ``setuptools``
        -  A working ``sendmail``/MTA (`msmtp <http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/>`_
           is easy to set up)
