Description: Giddy is an open-source python library for the analysis of dynamics of
        longitudinal spatial data. Originating from the spatial dynamics module
        in PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library), it is under active development
        for the inclusion of many newly proposed analytics that consider the
        role of space in the evolution of distributions over time and has
        several new features including inter- and intra-regional decomposition
        of mobility association and local measures of exchange mobility in
        addition to space-time LISA and spatial markov methods. Give
        giddy a try if you are interested in space-time analysis!
