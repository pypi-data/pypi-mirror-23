Description: gphoto2-cffi
        ============
        
        Python bindings for `libgphoto2`_ with an interface that strives to be
        idiomatic. In contrast to other bindings for Python, gphoto2-cffi hides most
        of the lower-level abstractions and reduces the API surface while still
        offering access to most of the library's features.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import gphoto2cffi as gp
        
            # List all attached cameras that are supported
            cams = gp.list_cameras()
        
            # Get a camera instance by specifying a USB bus and device number
            my_cam = gp.Camera(bus=4, device=1)
        
            # Get an instance for the first supported camera
            my_cam = gp.Camera()
            # or
            my_cam = next(gp.list_cameras())
        
            # Capture an image to the camera's RAM and get its data
            imgdata = my_cam.capture()
        
            # Grab a preview from the camera
            previewdata = my_cam.get_preview()
        
            # Get a list of files on the camera
            files = tuple(my_cam.list_all_files())
        
            # Iterate over a file's content
            with open("image.jpg", "wb") as fp:
                for chunk in my_cam.files[0].iter_data():
                    fp.write(chunk)
        
            # Get a configuration value
            image_quality = my_cam.config['capturesettings']['imagequality'].value
            # Set a configuration value
            my_cam.config['capturesettings']['imagequality'].set("JPEG Fine")
        
        Python 2.7 and 3.4 or newer (CPython and PyPy) are supported.
