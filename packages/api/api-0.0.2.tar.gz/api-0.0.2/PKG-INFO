        ## Requirements
        
        Package requirements are handled using pip. To install them do
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        
        Testing is set up using [pytest](http://pytest.org) and coverage is handled
        with the pytest-cov plugin.
        
        Run your tests with ```py.test``` in the root directory.
        
        Coverage is ran by default and is set in the ```pytest.ini``` file.
        To see an html output of coverage open ```htmlcov/index.html``` after running the tests.
        
        ## Travis CI
        
        There is a ```.travis.yml``` file that is set up to run your tests for python 2.7
        and python 3.2, should you choose to use it.
