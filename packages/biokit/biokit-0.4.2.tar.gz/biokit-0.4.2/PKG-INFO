        ===============
        
        BioKit is a set of tools gathered from several other Python packages. The goal
        is to gather tools that should be useful to develop computational biology
        software. Biokit contains a few plotting tools (viz module), some statistical
        analysis (mixture model), some tools to access to Taxon and GO identifier, some basic tools to manipulate sequences and so on. It is linked to BioServices package to provide access to biological resources. Lots of biological software are developed in R. We have also added a module to ease the installation and usage of R tools within BioKit.
        
        Installation
        ==============
        
        ::
        
            pip install biokit
        
        
        Note about testing
        ====================
        
        From travis, coverage is about 50% at the moment, which is low because some tests are ignored. Tests ignored are
        those that are slow or required R dependencies. To be ignored, we filled the setup.cfg with an option called **attr**. 
        IF you comment that attribute in the **setup.cfg** and run ::
        
            python setup.py nosetests
            
        You should reach a higher coverage (about 70%)
