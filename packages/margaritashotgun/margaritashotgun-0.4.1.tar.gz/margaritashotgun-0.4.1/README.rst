Capture A Single Machine
************************

A single machine can be captured using only the command line arguments for margaritashotgun.
First specify the server and user with the ``--server`` and ``--username`` flags.
Next provide a path to an ssh key with ``--key`` (or use a password with the ``--password`` flag).
Finally provide a lime kernel module with ``--module`` and specify an output file with ``--filename``

::

   margaritashotgun --server 172.16.20.10 --username root --key root_access.pem --module lime-3.13.0-74-generic.ko --filename 172.16.20.10-mem.lime

Save Memory In S3
*****************

To save a file to s3 replace the ``filename`` flag with ``--bucket``.  Ensure that you have aws credentials configured prior to executing the following command.

::

   margaritashotgun --server 172.16.20.10 --username root --key root_access.pem --module lime-3.13.0-74-generic.ko --bucket memory_capture_bucket``

Capture Multiple Machines
*************************

Run margaritashotgun with a configuration file like ``parallel_config.yml.example``

.. code-block:: bash

    aws:
        bucket: memory_dump_example
    hosts:
        - addr:     52.36.191.XXX
          port:     22
          username: ec2-user
          key:      access.pem
          module:   lime-4.1.19-24.31.amzn1.x86_64.ko
        - addr:     52.36.170.XXX
          port:     22
          username: ec2-user
          key:      access.pem
          module:   lime-4.1.19-24.31.amzn1.x86_64.ko
        - addr:     52.36.210.XXX
          port:     22
          username: ubuntu
          key:      dev.pem
          module:   lime-3.13.0-74-generic.ko
        - addr:     52.36.90.XXX
          port:     22
          username: ubuntu
          key:      dev.pem
          module:   lime-3.13.0-74-generic.ko
    workers: 2

Here parallelism is limited to 2 workers.

::

   margaritashotgun --config your_custom_config.yml.
