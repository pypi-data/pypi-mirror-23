=======================
Bag o' Hammers
=======================

    *Percussive maintenance.*

Collection of various tools to keep things ship-shape. Not particularly bright tools, but good for a first-pass.

1. Neutron resource reaper

  ``neutron-reaper {ip, port} <grace-days> [--info]``

  Reclaims idle floating IPs and cleans up stale ports. Pipe into ``neutron`` to act upon what it finds.

2. Conflicting Ironic/Neutron MACs

  ``conflict-macs {info, delete}``

3. Undead Instances clinging to nodes

  ``undead-instances {info, delete}``

  Nova instances that have been put to rest but still cling to Ironic nodes, preventing the next generation from being...ensouled? Checks for the inconsistency and fixed it.

4. Retry cleaning up after IPMI errors

  ``retry-ipmi {info, reset}``

  Resets Ironic nodes in error state with a known, common error. Records those resets on the node metadata (``extra`` field) and refuses after a magic number of attempts.

Common options:

* ``--slack <json-options>`` - if provided, used to post notifications to Slack
* ``--osrc <rc-file>`` - alternate way to feed in the OS authentication vars
