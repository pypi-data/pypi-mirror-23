        freely only to identify, advertise, or otherwise denote association
        or usage of the DendroPy library.

    4.  The test data files (available at ``dendropy/test/data``) have all been (a)
        sourced from public domain data, (b) obtained as part of example data
        bundled with other applications, and typically having been used in
        published analyses (c) generated using analysis programs from public domain
        data.

        In the case of (a), the data is from GenBank, and thus in public domain.
        Where possible, we have maintained citation information for the original
        authors/work that generated the data.

        In the case of (b), the original data is also available from the public
        domain. Where possible, we have maintained citation information for the
        original authors/work that generated the data.

        In the case of (c), no program we have used places any restriction on their
        output. We maintain the generated text ("File generated by DnaSp ... etc")
        to track provenance.
