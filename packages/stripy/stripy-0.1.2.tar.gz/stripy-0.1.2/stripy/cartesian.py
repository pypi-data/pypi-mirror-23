    """
    Define a Delaunay triangulation for given Cartesian mesh points (x, y)
    where x and y vectors are 1D numpy arrays of equal length.

    Algorithm
    ---------
     R. J. Renka (1996), Algorithm 751; TRIPACK: a constrained two-
     dimensional Delaunay triangulation package,
     ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 22(1), pp 1â€“8,
     doi:10.1145/225545.225546.

    Parameters
    ----------
     x : 1D array of Cartesian x coordinates
     y : 1D array of Cartesian y coordinates

    Attributes
    ----------
     x : array of floats, shape (n,)
        stored Cartesian x coordinates from input
     y : array of floats, shape (n,)
        stored Cartesian y coordinates from input
     simplices : array of ints, shape (nsimplex, 3)
        indices of the points forming the simplices in the triangulation
        points are ordered anticlockwise
     lst : array of ints, shape (6n-12,)
        nodal indices with lptr and lend, define the triangulation as a set of N
        adjacency lists; counterclockwise-ordered sequences of neighboring nodes
        such that the first and last neighbors of a boundary node are boundary
        nodes (the first neighbor of an interior node is arbitrary).  In order to
        distinguish between interior and boundary nodes, the last neighbor of
        each boundary node is represented by the negative of its index.
        The indices are 1-based (as in Fortran), not zero based (as in python).
     lptr : array of ints, shape (6n-12),)
        set of pointers in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of lst.
        lst(lptr(i)) indexes the node which follows lst(i) in cyclical
        counterclockwise order (the first neighbor follows the last neighbor).
        The indices are 1-based (as in Fortran), not zero based (as in python).
     lend : array of ints, shape (n,)
        N pointers to adjacency lists.
        lend(k) points to the last neighbor of node K. 
        lst(lend(K)) < 0 if and only if K is a boundary node.
        The indices are 1-based (as in Fortran), not zero based (as in python).

    Notes
    -----
     Provided the nodes are randomly ordered, the algorithm
     has expected time complexity O(N*log(N)) for most nodal
     distributions.  Note, however, that the complexity may be
     as high as O(N**2) if, for example, the nodes are ordered
     on increasing latitude.
