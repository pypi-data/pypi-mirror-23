        Pre Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``webkin`` depends on calibre CLI tools and uses ``ebook-convert`` to
        convert ``html`` to ``mobi`` format. Please ensure that you have Calibre
        installed alongwith CLI tools and ``ebook-convert`` is present in your
        PATH. For OSX users, you don't need to do anything besides `installing
        Calibre <http://calibre-ebook.com/download_osx>`__. I have tested it on
        Ubuntu 16.04 fresh VM and after installing Calibre, it worked fine. If
        you install using `this <http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux>`__
        method, you need to manually add ``ebook-convert`` to your path, while
        if you install it from PPA, it's automatically in your PATH.
        
        ::
        
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/calibre2
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install calibre
        
        `Source <http://askubuntu.com/questions/338172/how-to-install-calibre-on-ubuntu-12-04>`__
        
        First Time Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You need to export tokens to add your ``Amazon Email Address`` (should
        be present in your `Approved Personal Document Email
        List <https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=2019742>`__
        ), ``Kindle Email Address``, ``Mercury Web Parser API Key``
        ,\ ``SMTP Hostname and SMTP Port``. The first time setup will guide you
        on how to do that.
        
        -  To obtain your Mercury Web API key, signup
           `here <https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/>`__
        -  If you're using GMail, you need to add ``smtp.gmail.com`` as your
           ``SMTP_Host_NAME`` while the default port is ``587`` so you can skip
           adding that. If you're using any other email provider, you can find a
           comprehensive list over
           `here <https://www.arclab.com/en/kb/email/list-of-smtp-and-pop3-servers-mailserver-list.html>`__
           and add accordingly
        -  If you're using GMail and have turned on 2FA (which you must
           absolutely), you rather need to add an Application Password instead
           of your email password. Set a new one over
           `here <https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords>`__

           which I have shamlelessly adapted for webkin.

        Why ?
        -----
        
        Well, there are a couple of tools to already do this task, but I
        couldn't find any Open source tool which does it. Though Kindle uses a
        ``MOBI`` format which itself is closed source, I found the need of a CLI
        application to automate this boring task for me. If you're looking for a
        tool to do this but don't wanna use a terminal, you can also take a look
        at
        `this <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea?hl=en>`__
        chrome extension. I like my stuff in the Terminal so I did it :)
