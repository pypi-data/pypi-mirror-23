Description: clouddistrict
        =============
        
        Generate occupants and occupations for your custom village, town or city! (for D&D purposes or related)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI::
        
            $ pip install clouddistrict
        
        ... or from the project root directory::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Creating a town is simple::
        
            usage: clouddistrict create [-h] [--config CONFIG] output_dir
        
        Example create (defaults to town.yml if not specified)::
        
            $ usage: clouddistrict create --config example.yml example
        
        After running the create, you will see a new directory named "example", with lots of text files about the new people and buildings.
        For example, you will see entries like this in example/slums.txt::
        
            family#36 "Billesibyn"

        However, you will need a configuration yaml file to specify the information on each district.
        See ``example.yml`` included in the repository.
        
        ``example.yml``::
        
            # defaults if not specified in the district (in percentages, but any ratios work)
            race:
                human: 60
                elf: 20
                dwarf: 15
                half-elf: 3
                half-orc: 1
                halfling: 1

                    race:
                        human: 100
                    # Wealth determines the level of residences and commercial buildings, 1 2 or 3 (lower/middle/upper class).
                    # Wealth has to do with how much money a family starts with which determines how many businesses they can purchase and own.
                    # there are also some businesses which don't spawn in wealth 1 or 2. A bank won't spawn in 2, and an armorer won't spawn in 1.
                    # wealth: 2 will cover most of everything except a few businesses: Art gallery, bank, jeweler
                    # However, wealth 3 will allow any and every business and the wages will be higher than average, and the houses will be nicer.
                    wealth: 3

                middleclass merchant district:
                    # 30 shops of most things. We might see an Inn, an apothecary, a library. Wealth 2 includes almost everything.
                    wealth: 2
                    commercial: 30
                middleclass houses district:
                    # Houses and Cottages are found here. 20 families (1 family per residence).
                    # Families may be a nuclear family, a single-mother or single-father, or older siblings, or even just a single person.
                    wealth: 2
                    residences: 20

                    # Industrial relates to the "resource" type of buildings that house many workers
                    # The industrial currently available are: pier, mine, sawmill, quarry
                    # This means there will be 1 pier in this district. You choose how many and which specifically.
                    industrial:
                        pier: 1
                    # We specify water as true so we can have water type buildings like waterside taverns. Piers require it to be true in this case.
                    water: true
                slums:
                    # The slums welcome anyone, and people run small poor businesses. They may not own them, but they work there.
                    # Families in the wealth=1 areas are generally too poor to own businesses, though sometimes one might own a cheaper wealth 1 business,
                    # like a butcher shop or a tanner.
                    wealth: 1
