# cyberglove

Python driver for CyberGlove

## Installing

    pip install cyberglove

## Calibration

Run `gather_recordings.py` and follow the instructions in the viewer.

The first script will take care of running fitting too,
but if you need to manually run fitting run `fit_mapping.py`.

Finally, run `show_calibrated.py` to test out the calibration.
