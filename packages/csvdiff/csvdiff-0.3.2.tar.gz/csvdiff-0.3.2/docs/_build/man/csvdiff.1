.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
csvdiff [\-o OUTPUT.json] [\-\-style=STYLE] INDEXES FILE1.csv FILE2.csv
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBcsvdiff\fP command compares the contents of two CSV files and outputs any differences. The files must be in a standard CSV format, comma\-separated with a header row and optional double\-quotes around fields. The output is a human\-readable JSON patch format. The INDEXES parameter a comma\-separated list of fields, constituting a primary key for the files in question.
.sp
The options are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o OUTPUT \-\-output=OUTPUT
Write the JSON diff to the file OUTPUT instead of stdout.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-style\fB= STYLE
Choose between three output styles ([compact]/pretty/summary).
The compact and pretty formats output the entire diff;
summary outputs a count of rows added, removed and changed.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
For example, suppose we have \fBa.csv\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
id,name,amount
1,bob,20
2,eva,63
3,sarah,7
4,jeff,19
6,fred,10
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and a matching file after some changes, \fBb.csv\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
id,name,amount
1,bob,23
3,sarah,7
4,jeff,19
5,mira,81
6,fred,13
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now we can ask for a summary of differences:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ csvdiff \-\-style=summary id a.csv b.csv
1 rows removed (20.0%)
1 rows added (20.0%)
2 rows changed (40.0%)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or look at the full diff pretty printed, to make it more readable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ csvdiff \-\-style=pretty id a.csv b.csv
{
  "added": [
    {
      "amount": "81",
      "id": "5",
      "name": "mira"
    }
  ],
  "changed": [
    {
      "fields": {
        "amount": {
          "from": "20",
          "to": "23"
        }
      },
      "key": [
        "1"
      ]
    },
    {
      "fields": {
        "amount": {
          "from": "10",
          "to": "13"
        }
      },
      "key": [
        "6"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "removed": [
    {
      "amount": "63",
      "id": "2",
      "name": "eva"
    }
  ]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It gives us the full listing of added and removed rows, as well as a listing of what fields changed for that shared a key.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
The \fBcsvdiff\fP command exits 0 when no difference exists, 1 when a difference exists, 2 for a usage or other error.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The comparison is insensitive to column order by design; columns need not occur in the same order in both files.
.IP \(bu 2
All fields are untyped and treated as strings.
