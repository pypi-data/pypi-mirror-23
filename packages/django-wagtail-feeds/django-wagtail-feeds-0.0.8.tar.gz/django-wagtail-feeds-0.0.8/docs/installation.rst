Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

To install Django Wagtail Feeds, run this command in your terminal:

    $ pip install wagtail_feeds

`django-wagtail-feeds` has a dependency on `wagtail settings` app. You must add ``wagtail.contrib.settings`` to your INSTALLED_APPS::

    INSTALLED_APPS += [
        'wagtail.contrib.settings',
        'wagtail_feeds',
    ]

This is the preferred method to install Django Wagtail Feeds, as it will always install the most recent stable release. If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you through the process.
