Description: 
        # wc.py
        
        WordCount analysis of documents in Python.
        
        ## Overview
        
        This script provides a set of tools to analyse the number of occurences of words across a single or multiple documents.
        
        ## Installationg
        
        You can install it from pip by running the following:
        
        ```
        pip install wc.py
        ```
        
        This will install the script in your computer so you'll be able to call it directly with `wc.py`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Some example usages include the following
        
        #### Word occurences in documents in this folder recusively
        
        ```
        wc.py --paths ./
        ```
        
        #### Word occurrences in this folder docs with limit of top 10
        
        ```
        wc.py --paths ./ --limit 10
        ```
        
        #### Word occurences in specific file filtered on specific words
        
        ```
        wc.py --paths ./ tests/test_data/doc1.txt --filter-words tool awesome an
        ```
        
        #### Word occurences in folder with output truncated and only 2 columns
        
        ```
        wc.py --paths tests/test_data/ --truncate 100 --columns word count
        ```
        
        #### Saving output to file
        
        ```
        wc.py --paths ./ --filter-words tool awesome an --truncate 50 --output output.txt
        ```
        
        
        # Development
        
        ## Install VirtualEnv and Requirements
        
        Python 3.X is used, and it's strongly recommended to set up the project in a virtual environment:
        
        ```
        virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python3 venv
        ```
        
        Then install it using the setup.py command
        
        ```
        python setup.py install_data
        ```
        
        ## NLTK
        
        The previous command must have installed the NLTK dependencies, but if by any reason it's not working for you, you can install it with the following:
        
        ```
        python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
        ```
        
        Regardless this project has a fallback on REGEXes in case that the NLTK package fails for any reason.
        
        
        # Testing
        
        `py.test` is used to run the tests, in order to run it simply run:
        
        ```
        python setup.py test
        ```
        
        # Cleaning
        
        To clean all the files generated during runtime simply run:
        
        ```
        python setup.py clean
        ```
