Description: Transforming JSON Data in Python
        ================================
        
        This library is the basis for a data transformation algebra: We want a
        succinct way of transforming data in Python. We want operations on data
        to result in yet more data. We do not want data operations to raise
        exceptions. This library is solves Python's lack of consistency (lack of
        closure) under the dot (``.``) and slice ``[::]`` operators when
        operating on data objects.
