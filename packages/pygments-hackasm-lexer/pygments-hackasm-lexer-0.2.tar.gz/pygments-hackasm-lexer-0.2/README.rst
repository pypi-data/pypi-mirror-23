Nand2Tetris Hack Assembler lexer
================================

`Pygments`_ lexer for `Nand2Tetris Hack Assembler`_ language.

Part of the languages used/developed in the `Building a Modern Computer from First Principles`_ book.

Usage
-----

The name of the lexer is ``hack_asm`` so you can call it from ``pygmentize`` like this:

::

    pygmentize -l hack_asm -f html -O full test.asm

The recognize extension is ``.asm`` but it is as well used by many other lexers (like, you know, other assemblers), so I recommend passing  directly the lexer name.

Installation
------------

The lexer is available in PyPI, just install using ``pip``:

::

    pip install pygments-hackasm-lexer

And start using it.
