        glomex-cloud-deployment-tools (gcdt)
        ====================================
        
        gcdt is a CLI tool to code and deploy your AWS infrastructure.
        
        The gcdt command line tools have emerged from our experiences at glomex
        while working extensively with AWS services like Cloudformation,
        CodeDeploy, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway. gcdt is based on the same
        technology AWS uses to build AWS-CLI and Boto3 tools.
        
        In 2017 glomex won the Gartner award "Best Data Management and
        Infrastructure". Key to our success are the gcdt automation tools we use
        to successfully complete >100 deployments per day to AWS. Over the
        course of the last 12 months we built gcdt ourselves using Python.
        
        |Gartner Award|
        
        Features include:
        
        -  Infrastructure-as-code
        -  Classic infrastructure (kumo & tenkai)
        -  Serverless infrastructure (ramuda & yugen)
        -  Scaffolding
        -  Powerful plugin mechanism
        -  Service integration (Slack, Datadog, ...)
        -  Codify infrastructure best practices
        -  Multi-Env support (dev, stage, prod, ...)
        
        Why gcdt?
        ---------
        
        At glomex we love ``continuous-integration-as-code`` and
        ``infrastructure-as-code``. This enables us to move fast while providing
        services of high quality and resilience to our partners.
        
        We added a plugin mechanism to gcdt so we can specialize gcdt to highly
        optimized and opinionated environments that resonate with our usecases.
        
        We hope gcdt will be helpful to you, too. At glomex we believe that only
        open source software can become truly great software.

        Installing gcdt
        ---------------
        
        The easiest way to install gcdt is via pip and virtualenv.
        
        Defining which gcdt-plugins to use
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        gcdt needs at least some gcdt-glugins so you should want to install
        these together. The easiest way is to put the dependencies into a
        ``requirements_gcdt.txt`` file:
        
        .. code:: text
        
            gcdt
            gcdt-say-hello
            gcdt-config-reader
            gcdt-bundler
            gcdt-slack-integration
            gcdt-datadog-integration
            gcdt-gen-serverless
        
        This is also a best practice to use the ``requirements_gcdt.txt`` file
        on your build server.
        
        Prepare virtualenv
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        I am sure every Python dev uses virtualenv on a day to day basis. But we
        also use gcdt to deploy PHP, Ruby, and NodeJs projects. So I like to
        cover the basics:
        
        Prepare the venv:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ virtualenv venv
        
        Activate the venv for use:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ source ./venv/bin/activate
        
        Installing all dev dependencies in one go
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install the dependencies into venv:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install -r requirements_gcdt.txt
        
        Now you can start using gcdt:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ gcdt version
        
        BTW, ``gcdt version`` shows you all the versions of gcdt and installed
        plugins. So you can use this to quickly check which plugins are
        installed.
        
        Contributing
        ------------

        For pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines:
        
        -  Add tests for any new features and bug fixes. Ideally, each PR should
           increase the test coverage.
        -  Follow the existing code style (e.g., indents). UseA PEP8 code
           linting.
        -  Put a reasonable amount of comments into the code.
        -  Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.
