Description: flake8-rst-docstrings
        =====================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is an MIT licensed flake8 plugin for validating Python docstrings markup
        as reStructuredText (RST) using the Python library ``docutils``.
        
        This is based heavily off ``pydocstyle`` (which is also MIT licensed), which
        has a flake8 plugin called ``flake8-docstrings``, see:
        
        - https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle
        - https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-docstrings
        
        The reStructuredText (RST) validation is done by calling ``docutils`` via
        Todd Wolfson's ``restructuredtext-lint`` code:
        
        - http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
        - https://github.com/twolfson/restructuredtext-lint
        
        Flake8 Validation codes
        -----------------------
        
        Early versions of flake8 assumed a single character prefix for the validation
        codes, which became problematic with collisions in the plugin ecosystem. Since
        v3.0, flake8 has supported longer prefixes therefore this plugin uses ``RST``
        as its prefix.
        
        Internally we use ``docutils`` for RST validation, which has this to say in
        `PEP258 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0258/#error-handling>`_:
        
        * Level-0, "DEBUG": an internal reporting issue. There is no effect on the
          processing. Level-0 system messages are handled separately from the others.
        * Level-1, "INFO": a minor issue that can be ignored. There is little or no
          effect on the processing. Typically level-1 system messages are not
          reported.
        * Level-2, "WARNING": an issue that should be addressed. If ignored, there may
          be minor problems with the output. Typically level-2 system messages are
          reported but do not halt processing
        * Level-3, "ERROR": a major issue that should be addressed. If ignored, the
          output will contain unpredictable errors. Typically level-3 system messages
          are reported but do not halt processing
        * Level-4, "SEVERE": a critical error that must be addressed. Typically
          level-4 system messages are turned into exceptions which halt processing.
          If ignored, the output will contain severe errors.
        
        The ``docutils`` "DEBUG" level messages are not reported, and the plugin
        currently ignores the "INFO" level messages.
        
        Within each category, the individual messages are mapped to ``flake8`` codes
        using one hundred times the level. i.e. Validation codes ``RST4##`` are
        severe or critical errors in RST validation, ``RST3##`` are major errors,
        ``RST2##`` are warnings, while if shown ``RST1##`` are information only.
        
        Codes ending ``99``, for example ``RST499``, indicate a previously unseen
        validation error for which we have yet to assign a unique validation code
        in the assocated range, which would be``RST4##`` in this example.
        
        Codes starting ``RST9##`` indicate there was a problem parsing the Python
        file in order to extract the docstrings.
        
        
        Installation and usage
        ----------------------
        
        We recommend installing this plugin and ``flake8`` itself using pip:
        
        ```
        $ pip install flake8 flake8-rst-docstrings
        ```
        
        The new validator should be automatically included when using ``flake8`` which
        may now report additional validation codes starting with ``RST`` (as defined
        above). For example:
        
        ```
        $ flake8 example.py
        ```
        
        You can request only the ``RST`` codes be shown using:
        
        ```
        $ flake8 --select RST example.py
        ```
        
        Similarly you might add particular RST validation codes to your flake8
        configuration file's select or ignore list.
        
        Note in addition to the ``RST`` prefix alone you can use partial codes
        like ``RST2`` meaning ``RST200``, ``RST201``, ... and so on.

        TODO
        ----
        
        - Have the "INFO" level ``RST1##`` codes available but ignored by default?
        - Can we call ``docutils`` rather than bundle a copy of their parser code?
        - Create a test suite and use this for continuous integration.
