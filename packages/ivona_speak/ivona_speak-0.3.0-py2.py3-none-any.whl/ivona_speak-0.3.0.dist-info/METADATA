Ivona, Speak!
=============

|Build status| |Test coverage| |PyPI version| |Python versions|

Python script that lets you easily convert passed text to synthesized
audio files, with help of Amazon's `IVONA <https://www.ivona.com/>`__.
All you need is a pair of
`keys <http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/introduction.html#Credentials>`__
and this script. Yes, that's *literally* everything you need to never
speak again. If that's your thing of course.

If you want to use IVONA Speech Cloud directly inside your Python
project then you should have a look at
`python-ivona-api <https://github.com/Pythonity/python-ivona-api>`__,
which this script uses in the background.

Installation
------------

>From PyPI (recommended):

::

    $ pip install ivona_speak

With ``git clone``:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak
    $ pip install -r ivona-speak/requirements.txt
    $ cd ivona-speak/bin

Usage
-----

::

    $ ivona-speak --help

      Easily convert passed text to synthesized audio files, with help of
      Amazon's IVONA. All you need is a pair of auth keys.

      See https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak for more info.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      synthesize*  Synthesize passed text and save it as an...
      list-voices  List available Ivona voices

Examples
--------

You can provide keys either explicitly:

::

    $ ivona-speak --access-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY' --secret-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY' list-voices

or export them as environment variables:

::

    $ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='...'
    $ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='...'
    $ ivona-speak list-voices

The default subcommand is ``synthesize``, so these do the same:

::

    $ ivona-speak synthesize -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
    $ ivona-speak -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'

I want someone to say 'Hello world!', and say it quick:

::

    $ ivona-speak synthesize -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'

She sounds so nice. I want someone special to respond her:

::

    $ ivona-speak synthesize -o response.mp3 -n Joey 'How you doin?'

Tests
-----

Package was tested with the help of ``py.test`` and ``tox`` on Python
2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 (see ``tox.ini``).

Code coverage is available at
`Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/Pythonity/ivona-speak>`__.

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
and access keys before running ``tox`` inside the repository:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install tox
    $ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='..'
    $ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='..'
    $ tox
