        Python script that lets you easily convert passed text to synthesized
        audio files, with help of Amazon's `IVONA <https://www.ivona.com/>`__.
        All you need is a pair of
        `keys <http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/introduction.html#Credentials>`__
        and this script. Yes, that's *literally* everything you need to never
        speak again. If that's your thing of course.
        
        If you want to use IVONA Speech Cloud directly inside your Python
        project then you should have a look at
        `python-ivona-api <https://github.com/Pythonity/python-ivona-api>`__,
        which this script uses in the background.
        
        Installation

              See https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak for more info.
        
            Options:

            Commands:
              synthesize*  Synthesize passed text and save it as an...
              list-voices  List available Ivona voices
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        You can provide keys either explicitly:
        
        ::
        
            $ ivona-speak --access-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY' --secret-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY' list-voices
        
        or export them as environment variables:
        
        ::
        
            $ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='...'
            $ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='...'
            $ ivona-speak list-voices
        
        The default subcommand is ``synthesize``, so these do the same:
        
        ::
        
            $ ivona-speak synthesize -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
            $ ivona-speak -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
        
        I want someone to say 'Hello world!', and say it quick:
        
        ::
        
            $ ivona-speak synthesize -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
        
        She sounds so nice. I want someone special to respond her:
        
        ::
        
            $ ivona-speak synthesize -o response.mp3 -n Joey 'How you doin?'
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Package was tested with the help of ``py.test`` and ``tox`` on Python
        2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 (see ``tox.ini``).
        
        Code coverage is available at
        `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/Pythonity/ivona-speak>`__.
        
        To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
        and access keys before running ``tox`` inside the repository:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install tox
            $ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='..'
            $ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='..'
            $ tox
