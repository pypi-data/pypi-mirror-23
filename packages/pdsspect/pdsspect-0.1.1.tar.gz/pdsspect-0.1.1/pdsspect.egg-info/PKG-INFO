        Install
        -------
        
        On OS X you must first install the Qt UI toolkit using Homebrew
        (http://brew.sh/).  After installing Homebrew, issue the following command::
        
            brew install qt
        
        Install Using Pip
        +++++++++++++++++
        Install pdsspect using pip::
          
          pip install pdsspect
        
        Then install your choice of pyside, pyqt4, or pyqt5
        
        Install for Development
        +++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Create a new virtual environment, install the `pdsspect` module with git,
        and setup the PySide environment. You must install either PySide, PyQt5, or
        PyQt4 as well (recommend PyQt5)::
        
            Make a clone of ``pdsspect`` and change to main directory. We recommend
            making a virtual environment for to install ``pdsspect`` in.
        
            pip install -e .
            pip install PyQt5
        
        Now you should be able to run the `pdsspect` program.
        
        This works on Linux as well (Ubuntu 14.04).
