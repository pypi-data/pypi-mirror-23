Description: 
        Ginga is a toolkit designed for building viewers for scientific image
        data in Python, visualizing 2D pixel data in numpy arrays.
        The Ginga toolkit centers around an image display class which supports
        zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several
        automatic cut levels algorithms and canvases for plotting scalable
        geometric forms.  In addition to this widget, a general purpose
        'reference' FITS viewer is provided, based on a plugin framework.
        
        Ginga is distributed under an open-source BSD licence. Please see the
