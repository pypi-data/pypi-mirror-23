  Make a standalone lfm executable in your home called "lfm":

Known Bugs
----------
+ general:
  - after renaming a file, cursor should be placed over the new file name,
    but this is not always posible because we don't know new file name

+ vfs.py:
  - rar with password halts lfm, because process is waiting for a password =>
    => timeout if not output and kill the spawned process
  - tmpdir are showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when view/edit/...
    a file, instead of vfs dir (this is just a minor estetic issue)


Some ideas from mc
------------------
Alt + , - switch mc’s layout from left-right to top-bottom. Mind = blown. Useful for operating on files with long names.
Alt + t - switch the panel’s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long, user-defined. “long” is especially useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.
Alt + i - synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show the current directory in the other panel.
Ctrl + u - swap panels.
Alt + o - if the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and move the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. This is useful for quick checking the contents of a list of directories.
Ctrl + PgUp (or just left arrow, if you’ve enabled Lynx-like motion, see later) - move to the parent directory.
Alt + Shift + h - show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate than going back one entry at a time.
Alt + y - move to the previous directory in history.
Alt + u - move to the next directory in history.
