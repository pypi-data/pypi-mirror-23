Motivation
==========

Current Python task queues function well in the case where there is a
single app which needs to queue tasks for execution later. However, they
seem poorly suited to multi-application ecosystems.

Conversely, existing Python bus systems (`Zato`_, for example)
appear designed for much larger projects but at the cost of complexity
in both use and deployment.

Lightbus will target projects which fall in the gap between these two use
cases.

.. note::

    This was originally, briefly, and rantily mentioned in a `Hacker News thread`_.

Task queue vs bus
-----------------

A task queue typically enables a developer to execute a specific piece of code at a later date:

* A task queue is tightly coupled. The dispatching code must know what needs to be done.
* A task queue typically doesn't return results [#f1]_.

Buses on the other hand can be seen a little differently. A relevant definition is hard to pin
down, but I would say:

* A bus provides loose coupling. The developer says what *did* happen, not what *should* happen.
* A bus provides bi-directional communication.

Example
~~~~~~~

A user registers with your application. They upload a profile image, and you also need to
send them a welcome email.

**Task queue:** Your signup code enqueues two tasks; one for the image resize, and one for the welcome email:

.. code-block:: python

    # TASK QUEUE

    # Handling the signup
    resize_profile_image.enqueue(user_info)
    send_welcome_email.enqueue(user_info)

    # Tasks executed later
    @task
    def resize_profile_image(user_info):
        pass

    @task
    def send_welcome_email(user_info):
        pass

**Bus:** Your signup code publishes a single event. This event describes what happened, rather than what should be done:

.. code-block:: python

    # BUS

    # Handling the signup
    user_signup.publish(user_info)

    # Tasks executed later
    @subscribe(user_signup)
    def resize_profile_image(user_info):
        pass

    @subscribe(user_signup)
    def send_welcome_email(user_info):
        pass

Benefits & downsides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Benefits of this technique are:

* **More extensible** - events can be listened for without having to modify the producer
* **Future planning** - events can fired even if they are not immediately required
* **Less code** - marginal in the above example, but some events could have dozens of listeners
* **Loose coupling** is just pretty good üòÄ

Downsides are:

* **No longer explicit** - you cannot know what will happen by looking at the dispatch call [#f2]_.

Existing task queues
--------------------

With the above, I have identified a number of pain points with existing task queues.
This is based on my experience and conversations with other developers. I
welcome intelligent disagreement, agreement, or additions.

**Broker limitations** - Queues such as `rq`_ are limited by their
simplicity, in particular due to the choice of broker. This becomes a
problem when trying to architect loosely coupled apps (see above, and :ref:`implementation:Why AMQP`).

**Complexity** - `Celery`_ in particular becomes
conceptually complex when dealing with with multiple applications
communicating via AMQP. This is in part because Celery‚Äôs (/Kombu's) terminology
overlaps and somewhat conflicts with that of AMQP. Celery's documentation is
also pretty light on details when it comes to
more complex setups (as is Google).

**Conceptual mapping** - Task queue concepts do not map well to implementing
RPC and pub/sub. This is reasonable, and perhaps somewhere one would expect a bus
to perform better (more on this shortly).

**Testing & debugging** - I find writing tests for existing queues
harder than it should be. I want simple ways to both assert that a task was
dispatched and simulate incoming tasks. Both should take identical
parameters. I would also like to see much better debugging tools to
help answer the question ‚ÄúWhy is/isn‚Äôt App B receiving message X from App
A?‚Äù

.. [#f1] Many tasks queus definitely do support receiving results.
         However, 1) the implementation often leaves something to be
         desired, and 2) the conceptual mapping feels odd.

.. [#f2] My hope is that tooling can help here.
