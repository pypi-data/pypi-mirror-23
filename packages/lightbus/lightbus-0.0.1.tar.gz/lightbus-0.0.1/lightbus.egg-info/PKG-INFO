Description: Lightbus
        ========
        
        **Lightbus will be a new message bus for Python 3, backed by AMQP. Our
        focus is providing conceptually simple communication between multiple
        applications/processes.**
        
        Lightbus will be able to substitute for message queues such as Celery &
        Rq, but it will encourage a more extensible and loosely coupled
        architecture.
