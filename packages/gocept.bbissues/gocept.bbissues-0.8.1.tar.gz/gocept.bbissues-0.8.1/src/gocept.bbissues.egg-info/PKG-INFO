        Configuration
        =============
        
        You have to provide a config file with the following content::
        
            [config]
            log = issues.log
            html_export_path = export.html
            json_export_path = export.json
            # The next line is optional it defaults to index.jj2 in the package
            template_path = template.jj2
        
        
            [bitbucket]
            # The owner always has to be provided. All projects by this owner 
            # will be collected.
            owner = owner
            # Specific projects may be provided in the following way
            projects = owner:project1
                       owner:project2
        
            [github]
            # The owner always has to be provided. All projects by this owner 
            # will be collected.
            owner = owner
            # Specific projects may be provided in the following way
            projects = owner:project1
                       owner:project2
        
        
        The template will be rendered using jinja2, and could have the following content::
        
            {% for project in projects %}
                <h2>{{project.name}}</h2>
                {% for issue in project.issues %}
                    <h3>{{issue.title}}</h3>
                     <pre>
                     {{issue.title}}
                     {{issue.content}}
                     {{issue.status}}
                     {{issue.created}}
                     {{issue.priority}}
                     {{issue.url}}
                     {{issue.author}}
                     </pre>
                {% endfor %}
            {% endfor %}
