Welcome to **kevlar**, software for variant discovery independent of a reference genome!

Where can I find kevlar online?
-------------------------------

The online home for kevlar is https://github.com/dib-lab/kevlar.
This includes a source code repository, stable version releases, an issue tracker, and various developer tools.
Documentation for kevlar can be found at https://kevlar.readthedocs.io.

If you have questions or need help with kevlar, the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/dib-lab/kevlar>`__ should be your first point of contact.

How do I use kevlar?
--------------------

See kevlar's `installation instructions <http://kevlar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__ and `quick start guide <http://kevlar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html>`__ to learn how to use kevlar.

**Note**: Although a reference genome is not required, it can be utilized to reduce data volume at an early stage in the workflow and reduce the computational demands of subsequent steps.

**Another note**: kevlar development is currently focused almost entirely on finding novel variants in family-based trio and quad experimental designs.
However, the method lends itself easily to more general experimental designs, which will get more attention and support in the near future.
