Description: Dispatcher mechanism for creating event models
        
        PyDispatcher is an enhanced version of Patrick K. O'Brien's
        original dispatcher.py module.  It provides the Python
        programmer with a robust mechanism for event routing within
        various application contexts.
        
        Included in the package are the robustapply and saferef
        modules, which provide the ability to selectively apply
        arguments to callable objects and to reference instance
        methods using weak-references.
