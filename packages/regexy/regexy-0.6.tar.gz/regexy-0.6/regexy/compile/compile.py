"""
Tools for compiling a regular expression\
into some of the in-between conversions\
from infix regular expression to NFA

The compiling steps are not made for\
performance but for readability and maintainability.\
This is mostly because resulting NFAs should be\
compiled once and cached on import time.\
One-off scripts are not a use-case I care about
