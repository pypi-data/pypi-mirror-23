        `Webassets <https://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ |
        `Morepath <http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
        
        This package is somewhat similar to
        `more.static <https://github.com/morepath/more.static>`_, which integrates
        `bowerstatic <https://bowerstatic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ into Morepath.
        It is currently not really used anywhere, so you should probably stick to
        `more.static <https://github.com/morepath/more.static>`_.
        
        Now that you are sufficently discouraged from using more.webassets, these are
        the reasons it might be for you:
        
        * You don't have to learn about javascript package managers (i.e. Bower).
        * You can have your assets compiled on the fly.
        * Your stylesheets are rendered at the top, your scripts at the bottom. No
          configuration necessary.
        
        If you are alreay familiar with webassets: This package might not be as
        powerful as you're used to. It currently has little flexibility. It's also
        the first time the author uses webassets, so things might be off.
        
        If you're using Webassets differently than me and you want your ways to work
        with more.webassets, do open an issue. I'm happy to turn this into something
        more powerful.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The following app serves a minified jquery from `assets/js/jquery.js`
        (relative to the code):
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from more.webassets import WebassetsApp
        
            class App(WebassetsApp):
                pass
        
            @App.webasset_path()
            def get_asset_path():
                return 'assets/js'
        
            @App.webasset_output()
            def get_output_path():
                return 'assets/bundles'
        
            @App.webasset_filter('js')
            def get_js_filter():
                return 'rjsmin'
        
            @App.webasset('jquery')
            def get_jquery_asset():
                yield 'jquery.js'
        
            @App.path('')
            class Root(object):
                pass
        
            @App.html(model=Root)
            def index(self, request):
                request.include('jquery')
        
                return '<html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>'
        
        This will result in the following html (formatted for readability):
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <html>
                <head></head>
                <body>
                    hello
                    <script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/jquery.bundle.js?1234"></script>
                </body>
            </html>
        
        For it to work you need an 'assets/js' folder with a 'jquery.js' file in the
        same folder as your python file where 'MyApp' is defined.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.5.0 (2017-07-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Stops default filters from overriding asset specific filters.
          [href]
        
        - Adds the ability to define a list of filters (chain) on an asset.
          [href]
        
        0.4.0 (2017-07-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Adds the ability chain output filters (i.e. jsx -> jss -> minified).
          [href]
        
        0.3.4 (2017-05-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Render the script tag inside the body element instead of after it.
        
          This turns the output into valid HTML. Rendering it outside the body element
          as it was done before works in practice, but it is technically not
          valid.
          [href]
        
        0.3.3 (2016-10-04)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add Python 3.5 and make it the default test environment.
        
        - Update to work with Morepath 0.16.
        
        
        0.3.2 (2016-04-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Ensures that the webasset_path is always an absolute path.
          [href]
        
        0.3.1 (2016-04-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          [href]

          [href]
        
        0.3.0 (2016-04-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - *Breaking Changes* - This release changes everything!
        
          Assets are no longer registerd through special methods on the application.
          Instead proper Morepath directives are used. This enables better re-use
          of assets, less verbosity and proper support of inheritance (you can now
          have applications which define assets and child-applications which use
          those assets).
        
          Have a look at the `readme <https://github.com/morepath/more.webassets>`_ and
          at `the comments in the directives file <https://github.com/morepath/more.webassets/blob/master/more/webassets/directives.py>`_, to get an idea about what has changed.
        
          Don't hesitate to open an issue if you need help migrating your existing
          setup.
        
        0.2.0 (2016-04-06)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Adds compatibility with morepath 0.13.
          [href]
        
        0.1.1 (2016-01-24)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Disables webassets url caching if debug mode is active.
          [href]
        
        0.1.0 (2016-01-24)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          [href]

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          reload of the application is necessary to get the updated javascript files.
