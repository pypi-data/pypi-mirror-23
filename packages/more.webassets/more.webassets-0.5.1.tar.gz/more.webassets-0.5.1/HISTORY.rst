0.3.4 (2017-05-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Render the script tag inside the body element instead of after it.

  This turns the output into valid HTML. Rendering it outside the body element
  as it was done before works in practice, but it is technically not
  valid.

0.3.0 (2016-04-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *Breaking Changes* - This release changes everything!

  Assets are no longer registerd through special methods on the application.
  Instead proper Morepath directives are used. This enables better re-use
  of assets, less verbosity and proper support of inheritance (you can now
  have applications which define assets and child-applications which use
  those assets).

  Have a look at the `readme <https://github.com/morepath/more.webassets>`_ and
  at `the comments in the directives file <https://github.com/morepath/more.webassets/blob/master/more/webassets/directives.py>`_, to get an idea about what has changed.

  Don't hesitate to open an issue if you need help migrating your existing
  setup.

0.0.3 (2015-08-07)
