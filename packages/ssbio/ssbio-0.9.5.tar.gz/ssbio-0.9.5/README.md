## ssbio
This Python package provides a collection of tools for people with questions in the realm
of structural systems biology. The main goals of this package are to:

1. Provide an easy way to map proteins to sequences and structures
2. Directly link structures to genome-scale SBML models
3. Prepare structures for downstream analyses, such as their use in molecular modeling software

##### Example questions you can answer with this package:

- How can I determine the number of protein structures available for my list of genes?
- What is the best, representative structure for my protein?
- Where, in a metabolic network, do these proteins work?
- Where do popular mutations show up on a protein?
- How can I compare the structural features of an entire proteome?
- and more...
