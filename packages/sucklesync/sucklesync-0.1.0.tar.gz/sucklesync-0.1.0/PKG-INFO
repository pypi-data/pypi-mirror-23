Description: ==========
        SuckleSync
        ==========
        Sucklesync allows you to subscribe to remote directories, using rsync to
        synchronize the directories locally. It only synchronizes files that
        aren't actively changing.
        
        Sucklesync (currently) requires Python 2.
        
        ============

        Or:
          sudo ./setup.py install
