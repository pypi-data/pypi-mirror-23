The firehose of your JSON

Introduction
============

RFC 7464_ is a proposed standard for streaming JSON documents.
It is meant to be used for things like loggers,
which can use JSON to log structured data.
It is designed to recover gracefully from file truncation,
even in the middle -- such as what happens when a previous
run crashed badly, and the next run opens the existing
log file for appending.
