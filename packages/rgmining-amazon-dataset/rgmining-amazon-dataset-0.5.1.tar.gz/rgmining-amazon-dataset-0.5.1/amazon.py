"""This module provides a loading function of an Amazon Dataset.

The dataset consists of reviews for products insix categories.
The list of the categoris are defined :data:`CATEGORIES`.
If you give one or a list of categories chosed from the list to :meth:`load`,
the function will load only reviews for products belong to the given categories.

This package also provides a helper function, :meth:`print_state`,
to output a state of a graph object.

To use both fuctions, the graph object must implement the
:ref:`graph interface <dataset-io:graph-interface>`.

This is statistics of ratings and the number of reviewers:

============= ========================

2.0           16964
