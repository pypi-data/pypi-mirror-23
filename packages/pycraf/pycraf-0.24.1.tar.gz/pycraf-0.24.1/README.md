# Disclaimer #
`pycraf` is still in the early-development stage. While much of the
functionality is already working as intended, the API is not yet stable.
Nevertheless, we kindly invite you to use and test the library and we are
grateful for feedback. Note, that the documentation is still missing (but at
least docstrings are provided).

# Purpose #

`pycraf` is a Python package that provides functions and procedures for
various tasks in spectrum-management compatibility studies. A typical example
would be to calculate the interference levels at a radio telescope produced
from a ratio broadcasting tower.

# Features #

* Full implementation of [ITU-R Rec. P.452-16](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.452-16-201507-I/en) that allows to calculate path
  attenuation for the distance between interferer and victim service. Supports
  to load NASA's [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) data for height-profile generation.
* Full implementation of [ITU-R Rec. P.676-10](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.676-10-201309-S/en), which provides two atmospheric
  models to calculate the attenuation for paths through Earth's atmosphere.
* Provides various antenna patterns necessary for compatibility studies (e.g.,
  RAS, IMT, fixed-service links).
* Functions to convert power flux densities, field strengths, transmitted and
  received powers at certain distances and frequencies into each other.

# License #

`pycraf` is published under GPL v3, an open-source license.

For some of the functionality provided in pycraf, data files provided by the
ITU are necessary. For example, the atmospheric model in the pycraf.atm
subpackage implements the algorithm described in [ITU-R Recommendation P.676](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.676-10-201309-S/en).
Annex 1 of this Recommendation makes use of spectroscopic information of the
oxygen and water vapour lines given in Tables 1 and 2 of P.676.

ITU kindly gave us permission to include data files into pycraf that are
distributed with the Recommendations on the ITU servers. This makes it possible
to just use pycraf without the need to manually download necessary data files.
However, these data files are not free for commercial use. For details, please
see the [LICENSE.ITU](https://www.github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/LICENSE.ITU) file.

We are very grateful for the kind support from ITU study groups and ITU's
legal department.


# Installation #

The easiest way to install pycraf is via `pip`:

```
pip install pycraf
```

The installation is also possible from source. Download the tar.gz-file,
extract (or clone from GitHub) and simply execute

```
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies ##

We kept the dependencies as minimal as possible. The following packages are
required:
* `numpy 1.8` or later
* `astropy 1.1` or later
* `pyproj 1.9` or later

## Windows machines ##

Note, for Windows machines we provide a binary wheel (Python 3.5+ only).
However, the `pyproj` package is a dependency and unfortunately, the official
`pyproj` repository on PyPI contains only the sources. You can download a
suitable wheel from [Christoph Gohlke's package site](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj). Then use

```
pip install [path-to-wheel]\pyprojâ€‘*.whl
```

If you're using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (recommended), it is much simpler:
```
conda install -c conda-forge pyproj
```

## SRTM data ##

To make full use of the path attenuation calculations provided by `pycraf`
(implements [ITU-R Rec. P.452](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.452-16-201507-I/en)), we recommend to use NASA's
[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)
data for height- profile generation. `pycraf` can work with so-called `.hgt`
files, a very simple binary format. Each `.hgt` file, a so-called tile, just
contains 1201x1201 16-bit integers. From the file naming scheme, one can infer
the associated coordinates. Most tiles contain one square-degree.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide SRTM data as part of the package, due to the
large file sizes and legal reasons. But once you downloaded the necessary tiles
(all or only a subset appropriate for your region), simply define the
environment variable `$SRTMDATA`, let it point to the folder containing the
tiles, and `pycraf` will find the files when it is imported from Python.

# Usage #

## Examples and Documentation ##

Will follow asap. Sorry for the inconvenience! You can find tutorials in the
[`notebooks`](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bwinkel/pycraf/blob/master/notebooks/) directory on the pycraf repository.
