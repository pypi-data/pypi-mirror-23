Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PopPage is a simple command-line utility originally intended as a static
        website generator but has since grown into a
        `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`__ clone. The
        main features of PopPage are:
        
        -  Uses `Jinja2 templates <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ to generate
           output.
        
        -  Output can be single files or directories.
        
        -  The content applied to the templates can be strings or read from
           files directly on the command line.
