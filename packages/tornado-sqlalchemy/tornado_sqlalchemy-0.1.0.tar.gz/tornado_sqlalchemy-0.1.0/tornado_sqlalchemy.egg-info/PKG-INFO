        `tornado-sqlalchemy` is a Python library aimed at integrating the tornado_ web
        framework and the SQLAlchemy_ database toolkit.
        
        tornado_ is slightly different from the rest of the web frameworks, in that it
        allows handling web requests asynchronously out of the box. At the same time,
        making database operations asynchronous (especially when you put an ORM in the
        picture) is not that straight forward. Hence, the aim of this project is to
        provide a few helper functions which can help you handle your database
        operations easily in case you're combining the two libraries.
        
        This is not an end-to-end solution for your database needs, but rather it
        assumes that the developer knows what they're doing, how the two libraries work,
        and especially how `session handling`_ in SQLAlchemy_ works.
        
        This project is under heavy development, and makes no promises until the API
        stabilizes. You have been warned!
