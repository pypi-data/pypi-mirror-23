Description: ========================
        Allspeak
        ========================
        
        Allspeak is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) i18n/l10n solution
        for humans. It's flexible, easy to use and —unlike gettext— independent of
        any external compilation tool.
        
        How can the translator of your multi-language web application update a text?
        Compiling `.po` files for a web app, really? How the Rails community solved
        that problem? Translations in `yaml` or `json` files. With Python it should
        be that simple. **Now it is**.
        
        And the files used by Allspeak are compatible with those of Rails, so you can
        use any third-party service already compatible with them
        (for example, `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_).
        
        Powered by the awesome Babel and pytz libraries for the l10n part.
