Description: Fibratus is a tool which is able to capture the most of the Windows kernel activity - process/thread creation and termination, file system I/O, registry, network activity, DLL loading/unloading and much more. Fibratus has a very simple CLI which encapsulates the machinery to start the kernel event stream collector, set kernel event filters or run the lightweight Python modules called filaments. You can use filaments to extend Fibratus with your own arsenal of tools.
