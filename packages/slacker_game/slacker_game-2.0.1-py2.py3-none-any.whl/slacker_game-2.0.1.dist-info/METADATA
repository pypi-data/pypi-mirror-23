Slacker
=======

**Slacker** is a clone/parody of the popular arcade game *Stacker*, in which
you must stack blocks to the top of the screen in order to win the game. Boxes
will move back and forth at varying speeds. Press Space to stop the boxes and
move on to the next row. Only boxes that have something underneath them will be
stacked. As the tower rises, the game will make your tower thinner. You win a
minor prize at the 10th level (the blocks change color), and if you reach the
15th level, you will win the major prize. Good luck!

This game and the above description was originally written by Clint and
Jennifer Herron. I forked the game to improve the codebase, make it more
similar to the arcade game and hopefully add more features.

Installation
------------

**Slacker** can run on both Python 2 and 3. You can install it using ``pip`` or
run ``./setup.py install --user``.

Control
-------

Space
   Start playing or place your stacking boxes.

Escape, ``q``
   Return to intro screen or quit.

``1`` to ``9``
   Set the speed of the game (default: 5).

``0``
   Increase the number of blocks currently moving.
