@package CompoundPye.src.Components.highpass_filter
Holds the class HighpassFilter, which is a Component with a predefined
transfer function to turn it into a high-pass filter.

@todo I'm not happy with the high-pass filter's dependency on the time-step
dt! Need to change this! Same for the low pass.
