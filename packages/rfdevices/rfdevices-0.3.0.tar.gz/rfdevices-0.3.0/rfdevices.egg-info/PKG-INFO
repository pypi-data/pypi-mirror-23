Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        High level RF library for interacting with common devices.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        -  Python 3
        -  Native GPIO library (see Installation)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Clone this repo locally, then:
        ``bash pip install rfdevices``
        
        Native GPIO Library
        -------------------
        
        For GPIO operations, this library uses
        `adafruit/Adafruit\_Python\_GPIO <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO>`_
        for compatibility with multiple SoC boards. As a result, you'll need to
        ensure you manually install your platform's GPIO library.
        
        If you have a Raspberry Pi: ``bash pip install RPi.GPIO`` See `RPi.GPIO
        on
        Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/>`_
        for more information.
        
        If you have a Beaglebone Black: ``bash pip install Adafruit_BBIO`` See
        `adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python <https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python>`_
        for more information.
        
        If you have an Intel (e.g. Galileo, Edison) board, follow the
        instructions at
        `intel-iot-devkit/mraa <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa>`_.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installing, the ``rfsend`` tool will be available in your
        ``PATH``.
        
        Here's an example of sending a command to a UC7070T (Harbor Breeze) fan
        to toggle the light on/off:
        ``bash # GPIO pin 23 / fan dipswitch set to 1101 rpi-rftx -g 23 -t uc7070t -b 111010000001``
