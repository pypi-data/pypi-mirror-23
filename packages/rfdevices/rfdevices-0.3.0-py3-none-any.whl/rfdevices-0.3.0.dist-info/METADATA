Introduction
============

High level RF library for interacting with common devices.

Requirements
============

-  Python 3
-  Native GPIO library (see Installation)

Installation
============

Clone this repo locally, then:
``bash pip install rfdevices``

Native GPIO Library
-------------------

For GPIO operations, this library uses
`adafruit/Adafruit\_Python\_GPIO <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO>`_
for compatibility with multiple SoC boards. As a result, you'll need to
ensure you manually install your platform's GPIO library.

If you have a Raspberry Pi: ``bash pip install RPi.GPIO`` See `RPi.GPIO
on
Sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/>`_
for more information.

If you have a Beaglebone Black: ``bash pip install Adafruit_BBIO`` See
`adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python <https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python>`_
for more information.

If you have an Intel (e.g. Galileo, Edison) board, follow the
instructions at
`intel-iot-devkit/mraa <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa>`_.

Usage
=====

After installing, the ``rfsend`` tool will be available in your
``PATH``.

Here's an example of sending a command to a UC7070T (Harbor Breeze) fan
to toggle the light on/off:
``bash # GPIO pin 23 / fan dipswitch set to 1101 rpi-rftx -g 23 -t uc7070t -b 111010000001``
