Description: Diffusion.py
        ============
        
        This package is used to calculate 2-dimensional diffusion on a regular grid with the initial conditions
        defined in a png file. The border conditions are handeled by rolling over to the oposite edge and using the
        value specified there.
        This module is the final state in a row of examples for solving the same problem. All examples, shifting the very
        first quick&dirty soultion over a function-based version to this version are published in the GIT-project:

        This module was programmed in order to illustrate proper programming for scientist using an easy to understand
        example. It does neither claim to be performant nor comprehensive to solve diffusion problems.
        The example was taken from the great book: High Performance Python by Micha Gorelick and Ian Ozsvald (O'Reilly).

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package using:
        
        .. code-block::bash
        
          pip install diffusion
        
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        There is a command line tool called `diffusion.py` that takes an image with the initial conditions as a first
        argument, The diffusion parameter D as a second argument, the time step per increment dt as third argument and
        the total time steps to be simulated as fourth argument.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          python diffusion.py image.png D dt iterations
