        Install
        =======
        
        ::
        
            pip install spotify-onthego
        
        Note that you will need valid Spotify app credentials. If you don't have a
        valid client ID/secret pair of keys, you can create a Spotify app `here
        <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create>`_.
        
        Once you have created a Spotify app, you will also have to add a redirect URI
        for this app ("Add URI").
        
        After the first run of the CLI tool, the authentication token and credentials
        will be stored in a local configuration file.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        If you wish to convert the downloaded files to mp3 format, you will need to
        install avconv.
        
        For Debian/Ubuntu installation::
        
            sudo apt-get install libav-tools
        
        For OS X installation you will need to compile from source and you will need to
        have gcc installed::
        
            mkdir avconv
            cd avconv
            wget https://libav.org/releases/libav-11.tar.xz
            tar xjf libav-11.tar.xz
            cd libav-11
            ./configure --disable-yasm
            make install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            $ spotify-playlist -h
            usage: spotify-playlist [-h] [-S] [-a {webm,ogg,m4a}] [-C] playlist dst
        
            Download the tracks of a Spotify playlist from YouTube
        
            positional arguments:
              playlist              Name of playlist. E.g: 'Road music'
              dst                   Destination directory
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -S, --no-skip         Don't skip files that were already downloaded.
              -a {webm,ogg,m4a}, --audio {webm,ogg,m4a}
                                    Preferred audio format to download. By default, the
                                    best quality audio format will be downloaded. On some
                                    platforms (e.g: Debian Wheezy), the default avconv
                                    utility does not support audio conversion from webm,
                                    so you should specify a different value here. Note
                                    that this audio file will eventually be converted to
                                    mp3 (unless you specify --no-convert)
              -C, --no-convert      Don't convert audio files to mp3 format.

              -a {webm,ogg,m4a}, --audio {webm,ogg,m4a}
                                    Preferred audio format to download. By default, the
                                    best quality audio format will be downloaded. On some
                                    platforms (e.g: Debian Wheezy), the default avconv

            spotify-playlist "My Playlist" ./music/myspotifyplaylist/

            spotify-playlist "Mixtape*" ./music/
        
        Download favourite songs
        ------------------------
        
        Download your 30 most recent tracks from "My Music"::
        
            spotify-mymusic -l 30 ./music/mytracks/
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        In case of 401 error, this may be caused by a previous authorization token that
        did not have the right scope. Just remove the
        :code:`~/.local/share/spotify-onthego/spotify.token` file and start the command
        again.
        
        If mp3 generation fails with an error message related to eyed3, check that your
        installed version of eyed3 is at least 0.8::
        
            $ pip freeze | grep eyeD3
            eyeD3==0.8
