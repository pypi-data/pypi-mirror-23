Description: About
        -----
        
        **debrepo** is a library for inspecting composes of Debian repositories and
        their elements, including package archives. It includes classes capable of
        reading compose, repository, and package data from the filesystem, and methods
        to compare the data between different versions. To this end, the
        :doc:`debrepodiff` tool provides a command line interface for comparing
        composes.
