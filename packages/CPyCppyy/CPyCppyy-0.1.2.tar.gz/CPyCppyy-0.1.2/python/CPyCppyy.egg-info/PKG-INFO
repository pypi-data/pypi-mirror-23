        CPyCppyy: Python-C++ bindings interface based on Cling/LLVM
        ===========================================================
        
        CPyCppyy is the CPython equivalent of cppyy in PyPy.
        It provides dynamic Python-C++ bindings by leveraging the Cling C++
        interpreter and LLVM.
        Details and performance are described in
        `this paper <http://conferences.computer.org/pyhpc/2016/papers/5220a027.pdf>`_.
        
        CPyCppyy is a CPython extension module built on top of the same backend API
        as PyPy/cppyy.
        It thus requires the installation of the
        `PyPy cppyy backend <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPy-cppyy-backend/>`_
        for use.
        CPython/cppyy and PyPy/cppyy are designed to be compatible, although there
        are differences due to the former being reference counted and the latter
        being garbage collected.
