Canni
=====

If you are looking for the generated html code and/or want to use Canni for the Triple Trouble event:
https://networkjanitor.gitlab.io/canni/

Design Goals/Criteria
---------------------

* lightweight
* single page
* avoid javascript as often as possible (tabs with css, copy requires javascript :[ )
* offline portability (can save the file and open it from harddrive - still works)
* easy to use
* dataset source `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ (same as the linux terminal version of Canni: `bronk <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/bronk>`_)

Info about changes to the dataset
---------------------------------

Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll update the used dataset here from the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo.
If you have any specifc change requests, please feel free to create issues (or preferably pull requests) to either the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo or to this.

TODOs
-----

* make canni rebuild automatically when xutt changes
