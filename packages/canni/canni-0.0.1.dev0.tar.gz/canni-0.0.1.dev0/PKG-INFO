Description: Canni
        =====
        
        If you are looking for the generated html code and/or want to use Canni for the Triple Trouble event:

        Design Goals/Criteria
        ---------------------
        
        * lightweight
        * single page
        * avoid javascript as often as possible (tabs with css, copy requires javascript :[ )
        * offline portability (can save the file and open it from harddrive - still works)
        * easy to use
        * dataset source `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ (same as the linux terminal version of Canni: `bronk <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/bronk>`_)
        
        Info about changes to the dataset
        ---------------------------------
        
        Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll update the used dataset here from the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo.
        If you have any specifc change requests, please feel free to create issues (or preferably pull requests) to either the `xutt <https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/xutt>`_ repo or to this.
        
        TODOs
        -----
        
        * make canni rebuild automatically when xutt changes
