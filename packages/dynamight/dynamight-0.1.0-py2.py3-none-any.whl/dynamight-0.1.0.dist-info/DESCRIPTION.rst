A quick and dirty use of Python function annotations to apply strong typing to functions and methods at runtime. If inputs or outputs of a function do not match the type specified in the function annotation, a type error will be thrown. This strong typing is applied to individual functions/classes through a decorator. More documentation is available at the project homepage.
