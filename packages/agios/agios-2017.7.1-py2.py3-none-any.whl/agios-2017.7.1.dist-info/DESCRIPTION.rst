## What is agios?

agios is an open source, Python 3 library for playing with genetic algorithms. Main functionality includes:   

* Generic API allowing to easily implement custom tasks

* Highly customizable algorithm execution cycle

* Multithreading support

* Built-in support for images processing

* Multidimensional data processing



TODO list includes:

* Support for PyCUDA and processing on GPU



## How to install it?

```

pip install agios

```



## Where is an example code?

```python

from agios import evolution

from agios import extras



blueprint = extras.load_normalized_image('input/mona_lisa.jpg', extras.Greyscale)



evolution_problem_solver = evolution.SimpleSolver(

    population_size=100,

    best_samples_to_take=2,

    blueprint=evolution.NumpyArraySample(blueprint),

    mutator=evolution.SimplePaintbrushMatrixMutator((10, 15), (10, 50)),

    crosser=evolution.MeanValueMatrixCrosser(),

    loss_calculator=evolution.SquaredMeanMatrixLossCalculator(),

    initial_sample_state_generator=evolution.RandomMatrixGenerator(blueprint.shape)

)



for _ in range(10000):

    evolution_problem_solver.step()

```



Live examples can be found in examples/ directory.
