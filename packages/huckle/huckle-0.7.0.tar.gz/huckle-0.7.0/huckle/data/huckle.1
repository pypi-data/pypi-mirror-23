.SH NAME
huckle \- A generic hypertext command line interface (HCLI) client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B huckle
[
.I option
|
.I <command>
.I <parameter>
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B huckle
is a generic CLI that can be used with any API that abides by
the standard version 1.0 hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.
.SH COMMANDS
.IP "create <cliname>"
This allows you to alias into a new CLI. Restarting the terminal
is required since we're using a ~/.bash_profile alias.
.IP "cli <cliname>"
Used to invoke a CLI. Note that the <cliname> alias created with
huckle create <cliname> should be used instead, for brevity.
.IP "pull <url>"
This attempts to auto configure a CLI via the root URL of an HCLI. If successful, the CLI can be invoked:w
by name as if created via "huckle create". However, URL is automatically set for the CLI so no manual
configuration is required.

Note that an existing configuration file is left alone if the command is run multiple times
for the same cliname.
