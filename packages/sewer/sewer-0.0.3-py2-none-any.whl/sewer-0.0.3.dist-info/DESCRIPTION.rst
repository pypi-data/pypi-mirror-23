Sewer
-----

| Sewer is a Let's Encrypt(ACME) client.
| It allows you to obtain ssl/tls certificates from Let's Encrypt.
| Sewer currently only supports the DNS mode of validation. The only
  currently supported DNS provider is cloudflare but I will add more as
  time progresses.

Installation:
-------------

``pip install sewer``

Usage:
------

.. code:: python

    import sewer

    # 1. to create a new certificate:
    client = sewer.Client(domain_name='example.com',
                          CLOUDFLARE_DNS_ZONE_ID='random',
                          CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL='example@example.com',
                          CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY='nsa-grade-api-key')
    certificate = client.cert()
    certificate_key = client.certificate_key
    account_key = client.account_key

    print "your certicate is:", certificate
    print "your certificate's key is:", certificate_key
    print "\n\n"
    print "you can write them to a file then add that file to your favourite webserver."

    with open('certificate.crt', 'w') as certificate_file:
        certificate_file.write(certificate)

    with open('certificate.key', 'w') as certificate_key_file:
        certificate_key_file.write(certificate_key)

    print "your account key is:", account_key
    print "IMPORTANT: keep your account key in a very safe and secure place."

    with open('account_key.key', 'w') as account_key_file:
        account_key_file.write(account_key)



    # 2. to renew a certificate:
    import sewer

    with open('account_key.key', 'r') as account_key_file:
        account_key = account_key_file.read()

    client = sewer.Client(domain_name='example.com',
                          CLOUDFLARE_DNS_ZONE_ID='random',
                          CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL='example@example.com',
                          CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY='nsa-grade-api-key',
                          account_key=account_key)
    certificate = client.renew()
    certificate_key = client.certificate_key

    with open('certificate.crt', 'w') as certificate_file:
        certificate_file.write(certificate)

    with open('certificate.key', 'w') as certificate_key_file:
        certificate_key_file.write(certificate_key)

TODO:
-----

-  make it DNS provider agnostic
-  support more DNS providers
-  add robust tests
-  be able to handle SAN(subject alternative names)

FAQ:
----

-  Why another ACME client?
   I wanted an ACME client that I could use to programmatically(as a
   library) acquire/get certificates. However I could not find anything
   satisfactory for use in Python code.
-  Why is it called Sewer? Because, for the longest time now, getting
   certificates has felt like wading through sewers. That was before
   Let's Encrypt showed up.
   Also, I really like the Kenyan hip hop artiste going by the name of
   Kitu Sewer.
