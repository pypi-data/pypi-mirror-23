Polyhedra Inscribing Ellipsoids For Analysis of Coordination Environments
=========================================================================


**P**\ olyhedra **I**\ nscribing **E**\ llipsoids **F**\ or **A**\ nalysis of **C**\ oordination **E**\ nvironments (or |pieface|_) is an open source |Python|_ project intended for the
analysis of distortions of a chemical coordination polyhedron. The analysis is very general, irrespective of polyhedron size or nature of the distortion, and could be applied
to any problem where a coordination sphere with known coordinates exists, from extended inorganic solids to organic molecules. 
Full details of the method can be found in the original research article, |citation|_, including some interesting examples.

For many crystallographic polyhedra, distortion is difficult to rationalise simply in terms of deviations of bond lengths or bond angles from *ideal* values. By fitting the smallest volume :term:`ellipsoid`
around the polyhedron, distortions are defined in terms of the three principal axes of the ellipsoid and it's orientation in space. The distortion of this :term:`ellipsoid` can then give a simple description
of the distortions involved.

Citing |pieface|

Getting Started
===============

Once installed (see :ref:`installation`) |pieface| can be accessed either through a command-line interface (|cmdprog|) or a user-friendly graphical interface (|GUI|). 
Both should be available on the system command line/terminal, and also from the start menu (if installed using the Windows installer).

|GUI|
    Should be adequate for most users. This :term:`GUI` provides a clickable interface to commonly used |pieface|_ functions, and allows users to
    import :term:`CIF` files for analysis, and examine/save the resulting output.
|cmdprog|
    Gives terminal-based access to a wider range of capabilities, details of which can be found by typing |cmdprog| ``--help``.

    
In both cases, the input required is one or more :term:`CIF` files, and a list of atom types or labels to be used as polyhedron centres and ligands. 
Once calculated (which can take some time for a large number of files) the resulting ellipsoid parameters are saved as a text file (one per :term:`CIF` file).
The resulting ellipsoids and parameters can also be visualised interactively.

More detailed examples of usage can be found in :ref:`tutorials`.
