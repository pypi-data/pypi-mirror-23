Description: QmeQ: Quantum master equation for Quantum dot transport calculations
        ====================================================================
        
        QmeQ is an open-source Python package for calculations of transport through
        quantum  dot devices. The so-called Anderson-type models are used to describe
        the quantum dot device, where quantum dots are coupled to the leads by
        tunneling. QmeQ can calculate the stationary state **particle** and
        **energy currents** using various approximate density matrix approaches. As for
        now we have implemented the following first-order methods
        
        -  Pauli (classical) master equation
        -  Lindblad approach
        -  Redfield approach
        -  First order von Neumann (1vN) approach
        
        which can describe the effect of Coulomb blockade. QmeQ also has one
        second-order method
        
        -  Second order von Neumann (2vN) approach
        
        which can additionally address cotunneling, pair tunneling, and
        broadening effects.
