# The requirements for a ReadTheDocs build only. This file includes
# the subset of the ``requirements.txt`` packages which are required
# for documentation generation.
#
# This requirement subset works around the following problems:
#
# * ReadTheDocs build fails on the dcmstack package, since
#   dcmstack is not registered in PyPI. ReadTheDocs does not
#   honor the constraints.txt git locations.
#
# * ReadTheDocs build fails on cython and mpi4py, since the
#   ReadTheDocs environment cannot build C extensions.
