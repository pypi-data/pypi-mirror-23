Description: mix'EM 
        ======
        
        
        mixem is a pure-python implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting mixtures of probability distributions. It works in Python 2 and Python 3 (tested with 2.7 and 3.5.1) and uses few dependencies (only NumPy and SciPy).
