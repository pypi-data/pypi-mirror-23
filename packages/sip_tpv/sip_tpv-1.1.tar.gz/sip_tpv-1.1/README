Utilities for converting between the SIP convention for representing distortion
in FITS images, and the TPV convention.

This module includes the equations for converting from the SIP distortion representation
 to the PV or TPV representations, following the SPIE proceedings paper at
     http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1363103
     and http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/shupe/reprints/SIP_to_PV_SPIE2012.pdf .
The work described in that paper is extended to 7th order.
