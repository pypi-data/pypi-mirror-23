json-graph-repl
===============

Extensible command-line REPL for interacting with JSON graphs containing
business objects.

The JSON format is based on the ``json-graph`` specification at:
https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification

Sample graphs are provided in the ``tests`` directory.

To use from the command line, just point the ``jgrepl`` tool to your
JSON graph:

::

    $ ./jgrepl/jgrepl.py tests/food-graph.json 

Once in the REPL, type ``help`` for the list of available commands. Use
``ctrl-d`` to exit.
