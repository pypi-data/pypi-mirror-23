xarray-simlab: xarray extension for computer model simulations
==============================================================

|Doc Status|

xarray-simlab is a Python library that provides both a framework for creating
computational models from re-usable components and a xarray_ extension for
setting and running simulations using the xarray's ``Dataset`` structure.

**Warning: this package is currently under heavy development (no stable release yet).**
