**Developed since 2012, PyKE offers a user-friendly way to inspect and analyze
the pixels and lightcurves obtained by NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.**

What's new in PyKE v3? (July 2017)
----------------------------------

PyKE3 is the latest generation of the Kepler/K2/TESS toolkit.
It provides the following key improvements:

* PyKE is now a `pip`-installable package and supports both Python 2 and 3;
* tasks are now available both as command-line tools and Python functions;
* PyKE no longer depends on PyRAF and is TESS-ready.

Example use
-----------

With PyKE, you can directly visualize frames from a target pixel file.
For example, let's visualize target KIC008462852 (a.k.a. Taby's Star)::

    $ kepmask kplr008462852-2013098041711_lpd-targ.fits.gz --maskfile tabystar.txt

.. image:: docs/source/_static/images/readme/kepmask.png

``kepmask`` is an interactive tool that allows one to create an arbitrary
aperture mask which can be subsequently be used in another ``pyke`` tool,
such as ``kepextract``.

``kepextract`` performs simple aperture photometry in the pixels given by the mask
created by ``kepmask``::

    $ kepextract kplr008462852-2013098041711_lpd-targ.fits.gz tabys-lc.fits --maskfile tabystar.txt

To visualize the light curve, you may want to use ``kepdraw``::

    $ kepdraw taby-lc.fits

.. image:: docs/source/_static/images/readme/kepdraw.png

Installation
------------

If you have a working version of Python 2 or 3 on your system
(we recommend `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_),
you can simply install the latest stable release of PyKE using ``pip``::

    $ pip install pyketools

Alternatively, if you want to experiment with the latest development version of
PyKE, you can install it straight from GitHub::

    $ git clone https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE.git
    $ cd PyKE
    $ pip install -e .

Note: PyKE version 2 and older, which was in use between 2012 and 2016 and
required PyRAF, is available in the branch ``py27-pyraf``. If you want to use
PyKE2 within PyRAF, we recommend getting it through the `AstroConda channel <http://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#iraf-install>`_.
