Pytplot is a python package which aims to mimic the functionality of the IDL "tplot" libraries.  The primary routine (tplot) generates HTML files for the specified plots, and automatically opens the files in a browser tab.   These files have several user interaction tools built in, such as zooming and panning.   

Pytplot can be used in python scripts, or interactively through IPython and the Jupyter notebook.  

Install Python
=============

You will need Python version 3.5 to run pytplot.  

It is recommended that you install `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads/>`_, as it comes with a suite of packages that are useful for data science. 

You could also install python directly from `python.org <https://www.python.org/download/>`_.

Install pytplot
=============

Open up a terminal, and type::

	pip install pytplot
	
This will install pytplot and all of it's dependencies.  


NOTICE: It appears you may also need to install nodejs.  If you installed anaconda above, this can be done with the following command::

	conda install -c bokeh nodejs

Running Pytplot
=============

To start using pytplot in a similar manner to IDL tplot, start up an interactive environment through the terminal command::

	ipython 
	
or, if you prefer the jupyter interactive notebook::

	jupyter notebook
	
then, just import the package by typing the command::

	import pytplot
