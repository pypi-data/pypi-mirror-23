"""
Classes for writing and filtering of processed reads.

A Filter is a callable that has the read as its only argument. If it is called,
it returns True if the read should be filtered (discarded), and False if not.

To be used, a filter needs to be wrapped in one of the redirector classes.
They are called so because they can redirect filtered reads to a file if so
desired. They also keep statistics.

To determine what happens to a read, a list of redirectors with different
filters is created and each redirector is called in turn until one returns True.
The read is then assumed to have been "consumed", that is, either written
somewhere or filtered (should be discarded).
