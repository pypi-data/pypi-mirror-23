Description: Active Learning with Jupyter Notebooks
        ======================================
        
        This is a Python 3 library to read/write cells programmatically in
        `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ which anticipates upcoming
        `collaborative <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jupyter/r7QSObF5YSg>`_
        features in Jupyter.
        
        We use this at `O'Reilly Media <https://www.oreilly.com/>`_ for
        notebooks used to manage machine learning pipelines.
        That is to say, *machines and people collaborate on documents*, 
        implementing a "human-in-the-loop" design pattern:
        
        -  people adjust hyperparameters for the ML pipelines
        -  machines write structured "logs" during ML modeling/evaluation
        -  people run ``jupyter notebook`` via SSH tunnel for remote access
        
        For more info about use cases for this library and *active learning* 
        in general, see the `JupyterCon 2017 <https://jupytercon.com/>`_ talk
        `Humans in the loop <https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/60058>`_
        
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        The following script generates a Jupyter notebook in the ``test.ipynb``
        file, then runs it:
        
        ::
        
            python test.py
            jupyter notebook
        
        Then launch the ``test.ipynb`` notebook and from the ``Cells`` menu
        select ``Run All`` to view results.
        
        NB: whenever you use the ``put_df()`` function to store data as a 
        `Pandas dataframe <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_
        be sure to include ``import pandas as pd`` at some earlier point in
        the notebook.
        
        
        Dependencies and Installation
        -----------------------------
        
        This code has dependencies on:
        
        -  `nbformat <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat>`_
        -  `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
        
        To install from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nbtransom>`_:
        
        ::
        
            pip install nbtransom
