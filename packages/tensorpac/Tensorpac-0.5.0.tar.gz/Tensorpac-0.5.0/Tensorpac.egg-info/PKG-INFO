        Description
        ===========
        
        Tensorpac is an Python open-source toolbox for computing Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) using tensors and parallel computing. On top of that, we designed a modular implementation with a relatively large amount of parameters. Checkout the `documentation <http://etiennecmb.github.io/tensorpac/>`_for further details.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        In a terminal, run :
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            git clone https://github.com/EtienneCmb/tensorpac.git tensorpac
            cd tensorpac
            pip setup.py install
        
        Code snippet & illustration
        ===========================
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            from tensorpac.utils import PacSignals
            from tensorpac import Pac
        
            # Dataset of signals artificially coupled between 10hz and 100hz :
            n = 100  # number of datasets
            data, time = PacSignals(fpha=10, famp=100, noise=3, ndatasets=n, dpha=10, damp=10)
        
            # Extract PAC :
            p = Pac(idpac=(4, 0, 0), fpha=(2, 30, 1, 1), famp=(60, 150, 5, 5),
                    dcomplex='wavelet', width=12)
            xpac, pval = p.filterfit(1024, data, data, axis=1, nperm=100)
        
            # Plot your Phase-Amplitude Coupling :
            p.comodulogram(xpac.mean(-1), title='Contour plot with 5 regions',
                           cmap='Spectral_r', plotas='contour', ncontours=5, vmin=60, vmax=300)
        
            plt.show()
