Slack Bulk File Delete
======================

For free tier memberships, Slack has a limit of 5gb for file uploads, this
program wipes out old files.

Installation
------------

    pip3 install slack-bulkdelete

will create a new command `slack-bulkdelete`

Configuration
-------------

Create a configuration file with the Slack API token for a personal
account that has administrative privileges. (Bot accounts will not work.)

Acquire a WEB API token for the Group Manager account.
``https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens``

The API token is of the form `xoxp-nnnnnnnnnn-nnnnnnn-nnnnnnnnn-aaaaaa`.

Put the token, in quotes, in `$HOME/.slack_api_token` or the configuration
file you specify on the command line.  This file is a json format file, but
only has the one entry.

Use
---

Before letting it run for real, try using `--dry-run` to see what files
will be deleted and saved.

Notes
-----

Python 3 has some issues with Unicode encoding if the ``LANG``
environment variable is not set properly before the interepreter
executes code. Make sure that ``LANG`` is set to a utf-8 encoding such
as ``C.utf-8`` or ``EN_us.utf-8``.
