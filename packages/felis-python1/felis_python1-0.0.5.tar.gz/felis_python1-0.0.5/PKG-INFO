        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Basically, all lectures are in the *.ipynb* format of version 4.
        Therefore you need Jupyter to view them. One would need no installation,
        in case the notebooks run without errors. In case the dependencies shall
        be installed, this module can be installed using setuptools.
