Description: # django-cmsplugin-objects
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        Provides an extra toolbar in the django cms tools, allowing administrators easy
        access to the administrator pages for the currently in scope object or object type.
        
        For example, if the page contains a list of blog entries, then you will have the option
        to create a new blog entry. Which will pop up the admin form in the in-line django-cms
        modal dialog. (Usually when using ListView generic clas sbased views)
        
        If the page contains a single Blog entry object, then an Edit and Delete option will be
        made available and these operate much like the Create form.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install cmsplugin-objects
        ```
        
        Add the plugin to your site's middleware in settings.py::
        
        ```
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
          ...
          'cmsplugin_objects.middleware.ObjectToolbarMiddleware',
          ...
        )
        ```
        
        Then restart your web server.
