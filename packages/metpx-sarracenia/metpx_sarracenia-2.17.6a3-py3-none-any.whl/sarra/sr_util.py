"""

A single checksum class is chosen by the source of data being injected into the network.
The following checksum classes are alternatives that are built-in.  Sources may define 
new algorithms that need to be added to networks.

checksums are used by:
    sr_post to generate the initial post.
    sr_post to compare against cached values to see if a given block is the same as what was already posted.
    sr_sarra to ensure that the post received is accurate before echoing further.
    sr_subscribe to compare the post with the file which is already on disk.
    sr_winnow to determine if a given post has been seen before.


The API of a checksum class (in calling sequence order):
   __init__   -- initialize the value of a checksum for a part.
   set_path   -- identify the checksumming algorithm to be used by update.
   update     -- given this chunk of the file, update the checksum for the part
   get_value  -- return the current calculated checksum value.

The API allows for checksums to be calculated while transfer is in progress 
rather than after the fact as a second pass through the data.

  Time conversion routines.  
   - os.stat, and time.now() return floating point 
   - The floating point representation is a count of seconds since the beginning of the epoch.
   - beginning of epoch is platform dependent, and conversion to actual date is fraught (leap seconds, etc...)
   - Entire SR_* formats are text, no floats are sent over the protocol (avoids byte order issues, null byte / encoding issues, 
     and enhances readability.) 
   - str format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.msec goal of this representation is that a naive conversion to floats yields comparable numbers.
   - but the number that results is not useful for anything else, so need these special routines to get a proper epochal time.
   - also OK for year 2032 or whatever (rollover of time_t on 32 bits.)
   - string representation is forced to UTC timezone to avoid having to communicate timezone.

   timeflt2str - accepts a float and returns a string.
   timestr2flt - accepts a string and returns a float.


  caveat:
   - FIXME: this encoding will break in the year 10000 (assumes four digit year) and requires leading zeroes prior to 1000.
     one will have to add detection of the decimal point, and change the offsets at that point.
