Making accurate color scales for communicating data in visualizations is critical. In many presentations and publications unbalanced scales are used. A common error is to use color scales which does not have smooth and constant change in lightness, leading to difficulty in interpreting the visualized data. colcol provides Python code to deal with color conversions as well as with generating publication-quality color scales.
