Simpcap is a PCAP parser that lists basic information about specific packets in a PCAP file.
Simpcap checks the source and destination ports, layers, and TLS (or SSL) version for each packet.
Simpcap will display certain packets based on what flags and options are provided when the parser is executed.
Simpcap can output the results to the command line or to a TXT file.
