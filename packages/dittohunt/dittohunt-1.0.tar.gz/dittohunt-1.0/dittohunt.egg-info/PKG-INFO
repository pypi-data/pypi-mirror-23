Description: Ditto Hunt
        ==========
        
        Ditto Hunt is a duplicate file finder that quickly finds duplicate files
        recursively under a folder and allows you to preview and then select
        which versions should be deleted or moved to another folder. It does not
        use filenames for comparison, and instead does a binary comparison of
        all files.
        
        This utility is handy, for example, if you have a bunch of images and
        want to find and get rid of duplicate images. However, it can be used
        with any file type.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Quick duplicate file search.
        -  Multi platform.
        -  Easy and straightforward to use.
        
        Runtime Requirements
        --------------------
        
        This is just an overview of runtime requirements. All major versions of
        both the Python interpreter and QT API are supported.
        
        -  `Python2 or Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`__
        -  `PyQt4 or
           PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`__ or
           `PySide <https://wiki.qt.io/PySide>`__
        -  `Qt <https://www.qt.io/>`__
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        For simplicity, instructions for only PyQt4 and Python2 are listed here.
        However, you can adjust to use any combination of Python2/Python3 and
        PyQt4/PyQt5/Pyside if you prefer when it comes to runtime dependencies.
        
        On Ubuntu, first install dependencies using the system package manager.
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install python python-qt4 python-serial python-pip
        
        Then, use pip to install dittohunt.
        
        ::
        
            pip install [--user] dittohunt
        
        Or, if you're installing from source:
        
        ::
        
            pip install [--user] dittohunt-<version>.tar.bz2
        
        The --user option causes dittohunt to be installed in your home
        directory under ~/.local.
        
        Then, if you somehow get fed up with Ditto Hunt's awesomeness, uninstall
        it.
        
        ::
        
            pip uninstall dittohunt
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Just execute ``dittohunt``.

        PyQt4/PyQt5/PySide
        ------------------
        
        Ditto Hunt can use PyQt4, PyQt5, or PySide for its Qt API. As long as
        you have one installed, it will be automatically detected and used at
        runtime. However, if you wish to force a specific Qt API, you can set
        the QT\_API environment variable to one of the following values when
        running.
        
        ::
        
            QT_API=pyqt4 dittohunt
            QT_API=pyqt5 dittohunt
            QT_API=pyside dittohunt
