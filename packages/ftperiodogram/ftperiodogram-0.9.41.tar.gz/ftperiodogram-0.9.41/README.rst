[Scipy 2017 talk is now on Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STeeVnfYFM)

The Fast Template Periodogram extends the Generalized Lomb-Scargle
periodogram ([Zechmeister and Kurster 2009](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:0901.2573])) 
for arbitrary (periodic) signal shapes. A template is first approximated
by a truncated Fourier series of length `H`. The Non-equispaced Fast Fourier Transform
[NFFT](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/) is used
to efficiently compute frequency-dependent sums.

The `ftperiodogram` library is complete with API documentation and consistency
checks using `py.test`.

### Older methods

The [gatspy](http://www.astroml.org/gatspy/) library has an implementation of
both single and multiband template fitting, however this implementation
uses non-linear least-squares fitting to compute the optimal parameters 
(amplitude, phase, constant offset) of the template fit at each frequency. That
process scales as `N_obs*N_f`, where `N` is the number of observations and
`N_f` is the number of frequencies at which to calculate the periodogram.

This process is extremely slow. [Sesar et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08596) applied a similar
template fitting procedure to multiband Pan-STARRS photometry and found that
(1) template fitting was significantly more accurate for estimating periods
of RR Lyrae stars, but that (2) it required a substantial amount of 
computational resources to perform these fits.

### How do we speed this up?

* The non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
* Polynomial zero-finding

The FTP is a non-linear extension of the GLS. The nonlinearity
of the problem can be reduced to finding the zeros of 
a complex, order `6H-1` polynomial at each trial frequency.

Templates are assumed to be well-approximated by a short truncated Fourier series 
of length `H`. Using this representation, the optimal parameters 
(amplitude, phase, offset) of the template fit at a given trial frequency
can then be found *exactly* after finding the roots of 
a polynomial at each trial frequency.

The coefficients of these polynomials involve sums that can be efficiently
evaluated with non-equispaced fast Fourier transforms. These sums
can be computed in `O(HN_f log(HN_f))` time.

In its current state, the root-finding procedure is the rate limiting step.
This unfortunately means that for now the fast template periodogram scales as 
`N_f*(H^3)`. We are working to reduce the computation time so that the entire 
procedure scales as `HN_f log(HN_f)` for reasonable values of `H` (`< 10`).

However, even for small cases where `H=6` and `N_obs=10`, this procedure is 
about an order of magnitude faster than the `gatspy` template modeler.


### How is this different than the multi-harmonic periodogram?

The multi-harmonic periodogram ([Bretthorst 1988](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-9399-3), [Schwarzenberg-Czerny (1996)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/309985/meta)) is another 
extension of Lomb-Scargle that fits a truncated Fourier series to the data 
at each trial frequency. This is nice if you have a strong non-sinusoidal signal 
and a large dataset. This algorithm can also be made to scale as
`HN_f logHN_f` ([Palmer 2009](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/695/1/496/meta)).

However, the multi-harmonic periodogram is fundamentally different than template fitting. 
In template fitting, the relative amplitudes and phases of the Fourier series are *fixed*. 
In a multi-harmonic periodogram, the relative amplitudes and phases of the Fourier series are 
*free parameters*. These extra free parameters mean that

1. you need a larger number of observations `N_obs` to reach the same signal to noise, and 
2. you are more likely to detect a multiple of the true frequency. 

For a discussion of number (2) and possible remedies with Tikhonov regularization, and for an illuminating review
of periodograms in general, see [Vanderplas et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...812...18V) and
[Vanderplas (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09824).

### Timing

![timing](plots/timing_vs_ndata.png "Timing compared to non-linear optimization (10 initial guesses)")

The Fast Template Periodogram seems to do better than Gatspy-like template fitting
for virtually all reasonable cases (reasonable meaning a small-ish
number of harmonics are needed to accurately approximate the template,
and small-ish meaning less than about 10).

It may be surprising that FTP appears to scale as `NH`, instead of
`NH log NH`, but that's because the NFFT is not the limiting factor (yet).
Most of the computation time is spent calculating polynomial coefficients,
and this computation scales as roughly `NH^3`. 

![timingnh](plots/timing_vs_nharm.png "Timing vs harmonics")

The FTP scales sub-linearly to linearly with the number of harmonics `H`
for `H < 10`, and for larger number of harmonics scales as `H^3` (since
zeros are found via singular value decomposition of the polynomial companion matrix). 
This limits the set of templates to those that are sufficiently approximated by a small
number of Fourier terms.

### Accuracy

Compared with the Gatspy template modeler, the FTP provides improved accuracy as well as speed. 
For many values of `p(freq)`, the FTP correlates strongly with results obtained from
non-linear optimization. However, since the problem is not convex, the solution recovered from
non-linear optimization techniques may only represent a *local* minima. FTP, on the other 
hand, solves for all local minima simultaneously, from which the globally optimal solution can be
found easily.

The FTP requires that templates be *approximated* by a truncated Fourier expansion. The figure
below compares the template periodograms for a single template approximated by different numbers
of harmonics:
