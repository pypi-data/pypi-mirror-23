Overview
========

Cloudomate is an unpermissioned open compute API which provides an automated way to buy VPS instances from multiple providers. The easiest way to use Cloudomate is via the command-line interface. 

Requirements
============

* Python 2.7
* python-lxml installed on the system
* Works on Linux, Mac OSX, BSD
* An active Electrum_ wallet with sufficient funds

Installation
============

The project can be installed through pip ::

   apt-get install python-lxml
   pip install cloudomate


Providers
=========

Currently the following VPS providers are implemented: ::

   linevast       https://linevast.de/
   pulseservers   https://pulseservers.com/
   rockhoster     https://rockhoster.com/
   blueangelhost  https://www.blueangelhost.com/
   ccihosting     http://www.ccihosting.com/
   crowncloud     http://crowncloud.net/

This same list can be accessed through the list command. ::

   cloudomate list


Configuration
-------------

For some commands, mainly purchase, user configuration is required. The
main way to do this is through a configruation file. For Linux, the default
location for the configuration file is `$HOME/.config/cloudomate.cfg`.

A configuration file looks like this ::

   [User]
   email = 
   firstName = 
   lastName = 
   companyName = 
   phoneNumber = 
   password = 

   [Address]
   address = 
   city = 
   state = 
   countryCode = 
   zipcode = 

   [Server]
   rootpw = 
   ns1 = 
   ns2 = 
   hostname = 


Section can be overridden for specific providers by adding a section,
for example a [rockhoster] section can contain a separate email address only
to be used for RockHoster.
