Description: ASAMBA (AsteroSeismic Approach towards understanding Massive Blue stArs) is a Marie Curie project                 that tries to infer deep physical understanding of the internal structure and evolution of massive                 stars in the light of recent very high precision space observations of pulsating massive stars.
        
                         Under this umbrella, a large grid of stellar models (using MESA) are computed, and the theoretical                 pulsation frequencies of each model (after iterating over various rotation rates) are also computed                using the (GYRE) code. From this rich dataset (~3.8 million stellar models, and 42 million frequency                lists), a PostgreSQL database is built, and is made openly accessible.
        
                         The present Python package provides a convenient user interface that offers all available functionalities                 to the users, and allows them to interact with the database, and conduct their own research of interest.                 Needless to say that the user must have a full understanding of the meaning of the parameters he/she uses                 which steer the analysis. We strongly recommend reading the source code, the documentation around most of                 the code blocks, and the compiled documentation pages that ships in with this package.
