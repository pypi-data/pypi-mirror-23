**This** is an example of a markdown paragraph: markdown recognizes only
six levels of heading, so we use seven or more levels to mark "normal"
text. Here you can use the full markdown
`syntax <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>`__. *Note*
the trailing line: markdown needs an empty line to end a paragraph.
