        System Name Local Link Connection
        ---------------------------------
        
        The ``system_name_llc`` plugin uses LLDP data gathered by the discovery ramdisk
        to populate the ``switch_info`` field of the ``local_link_connection``
        attribute of ironic ports.  The field is populated with the contents of the
        system name LLDP TLV if it was received by that port.
