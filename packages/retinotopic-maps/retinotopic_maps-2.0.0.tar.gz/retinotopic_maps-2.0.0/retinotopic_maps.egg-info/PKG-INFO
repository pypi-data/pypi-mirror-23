        For a more thorough introduction and explanation of the module please 
        see our [documentation](http://retinotopic-mapping.readthedocs.io/).
        
        The retinotopic mapping package is a self-contained module
        for performing automated segmentation of the mouse
        visual cortex. The experimental setup and analysis routine was
        modified from Garrett et al. 2014 (1), and closely follows
        the protocols and procedures documented in Juavinett et al. 2016
        (2).
        
        The code base contains several stimulus routines which are
        highly customizable and designed to give the user significant
        flexibility and control in creative experimental design. There
        are two distinct but connected aspects to the package:
        
        1. an online experimental component comprised of the
        `MonitorSetup`, `StimulusRoutines`, and
        `DisplayStimulus` modules
        
        2. an offline automated analysis component provided
        by the `RetinotopicMapping` module
        
        The analysis takes visual altitude and azimuth maps of mouse cortex as inputs, calculates the visual 
        sign of each pixel and auto-segments the cortical surface into primary visual cortex and multiple higher
        visual cortices. Ideally, the visual altitude and azimuth maps can be generated by fourier analysis of
        population cortical responses to periodic sweeping checker board visual stimuli (3, 4). 
        
        The package also provides some useful plotting functions to visualize the results.
        
        Please check the jupyter notebook in the '\examples' folder for a documented that takes an experimental
        data set generated from the `StimulusRoutine.py` module and then performs an automated visual segmentation
        of the mouse cortex using the `Retinotopic.py` module

        #### Issues:
        
        1. Most image analysis parameters are defined as number of pixels, not microns.
        2. Works in windows, but not fully tested on Mac and Linux.
