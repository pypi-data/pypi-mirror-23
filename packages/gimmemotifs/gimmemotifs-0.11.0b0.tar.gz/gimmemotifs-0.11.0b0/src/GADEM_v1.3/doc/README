This program was developed by Leping Li of the National Institutes of 
Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.


INSTALLATION

In the main directory of the distribution, type

./configure

then

make

make install

By default, the configure program will direct the executable files to 
/usr/local/bin which, in most cases, requires the user to "su" to root 
prior to the "make install" step. The target directory for the executable 
file can be overridden by specifying the --prefix option during the 
configure phase. For example,

./configure --prefix=/home/gadem_user

will direct the executables into /home/gadem_user/bin directory.

The configure application accepts several arguments to tailor the build 
and installation process. Please see the INSTALL file contained in the root 
directory of the distribution for further details.

The source code and package were developed using Windows and tested on 
Linux (Fedora). Although the intent was to make the code portable to most U*IX 
variants, you may encounter minor build issues on other platforms. Feedback 
regarding any difficulties you may experience will be very helpful in improving 
the distribution package.
