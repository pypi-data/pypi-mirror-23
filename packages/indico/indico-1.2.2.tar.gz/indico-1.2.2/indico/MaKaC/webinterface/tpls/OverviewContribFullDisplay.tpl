        There are two templates for cotributions, this one and
        OverviewContribMinDisplay but they display exactely the
        same amount of information.

        There is another problem though, currently the contributions
        inside a session looks exactely the same as the contributions
        that is on the top level. That is, it's impossible to know
        if the contribution belongs to a session or to the event itself.
