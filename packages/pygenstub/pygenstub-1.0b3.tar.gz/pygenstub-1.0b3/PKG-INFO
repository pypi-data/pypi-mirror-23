Description: pygenstub is a utility for generating stub files from Python source files.
        It takes a source file as input and creates a stub file with the same base name
        and the ``.pyi`` extension.
        
        :PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygenstub/
        :Repository: https://bitbucket.org/uyar/pygenstub
        :Documentation: https://pygenstub.readthedocs.io/
        
        If the docstring of a function includes a **sig** field, the value of that
        field will be used to generate a prototype by matching the types to the
        parameters in the same order. For example:
        
        :code:
        
           .. code-block:: python
        
              def foo(a, b):
                  """Do foo.
        
                  :sig: (int, str) -> None
                  """
        
        :stub:
        
           .. code-block:: python
        
              def foo(a: int, b: str) -> None: ...
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        pygenstub can be installed using pip::
        
          $ pip install pygenstub
        
        Installation creates a script named ``pygenstub`` which can be used
        as follows::
        
          $ pygenstub foo.py
        
        This command will generate the file ``foo.pyi`` in the same directory
        as the input file. If the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
        
        .. tip::
        
           pygenstub can be used with PyCharm file watchers to update stub files
           automatically when source files are modified.
        
        pygenstub consists of a single module which itself contains signature fields
        and commands as described in the documentation. You can see the `source code`_
        and the autogenerated `stub file`_ as an example.
        
        .. note::
        
           Generating stub files this way might not be a good idea in some cases.
           However, if you're not manually writing your ``.pyi`` files,
           pygenstub should be harmless.
        
        Sphinx autodoc support
        ----------------------
        
        If pygenstub is activated as a Sphinx extension (after 'sphinx.ext.autodoc')
        in the Sphinx configuration file, it will insert type comments for parameters
        and return values in the docstring. It will also remove the signature fields
        to exclude them from the output:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           extensions = [
               'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
               'pygenstub'
           ]
        
        As an example of the output, you can see the `API documentation`_
        for pygenstub itself.
