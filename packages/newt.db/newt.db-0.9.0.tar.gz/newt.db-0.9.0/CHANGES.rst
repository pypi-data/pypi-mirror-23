Changes
=======

0.9.0 (2017-06-29)
------------------

- Added an experimental feature to update auxiliary tables to support
  indexing data that comes from multiple newt records. (More on this
  later if initial experiment confirm the usefulness of this
  feature.)


0.8.0 (2017-06-20)
------------------

- Changed the way records are written to the ``newt`` table:

  - Records are written in object id order.

  - Updated are applied using "upserts" so that records don't
    disappear during the update process, which previously caused
    breakage when PostgreSQL operations during update (triggers or
    indexes) examined multiple records.

- Postgres 9.5 or later is now required.


0.7.0 (2017-05-26)
------------------

- Fixed: newt.db.search.query_data didn't accept an ordinary ZODB connection.

- The methods in newt.db.search that accept a connection now
  accept a database object (in addition to a Newt or ZODB connection).


0.6.0 (2017-04-19)
------------------

- Add a -x/--transform option to the updater to specify a
  data-transformation function.

0.5.3 (2017-04-18)
------------------

- Fixed: Newt DB couldn't be added to an existing RelStorage database.

- Removed the updater ``--redo`` option. It was implemented incorrectly.
  Implementing it correctly will be necessary at some point, but for
  now, we'll punt.

- Added a new ``--compute-missing`` option to compute missing Newt
  records after updating an application from plain RelStorage. (This
  is similar to the removed ``--redo`` but simpler and narrower in
  scope.)


0.5.2 (2017-04-01)
------------------

- Fixed: Newt DB didn't work with RelStorage 2.1.


0.5.1 (2017-03-30)
------------------

- Fixed: When arguments are omitted, there were errors because
  psycopg2 was trying to do substitutions anyway and choking on ``%``
  characters in ``like`` queries.

- Fixed: Connection.search_batch didn't allow arguments to be omitted.


0.5.0 (2017-03-30)
------------------

- The ``newt.db.search`` module has a new ``read_only_cursor``
  function for obtaining a `database cursor
  <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/cursor.html>`_ for selecting data and
  for using the `cursor's mogrify method
  <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/cursor.html#cursor.mogrify>`_.

- The helpers for setting up full-text search indexes now accept a
  config argument to specify the name of a PostgreSQL full-text search
  configuration.

- The batch search methods (``search_batch``, and ``where_batch``) now
  allow the arguments parameter to be omitted, which is useful when
  substitutions have been be applied with a `cursor mogrify method
  <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/cursor.html#cursor.mogrify>`_ before
  calling them.

- The search methods (``search``, ``search_batch``, ``where`` and
  ``where_batch``) now accept binary queries.  This is allow
  substitutions to be applied with a `cursor mogrify method
  <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/cursor.html#cursor.mogrify>`_ before
  calling them.


0.4.0 (2017-03-25)
------------------

- Serialization of persistent object references and intra-record
  references (used only when there are cycles) was simplified and made
  easier to use.

  Note: The change to intra-object references is backward
  incompatible, however, intra-record cycles, and thus the use of
  intra-record references, are extremely rare and it isn't thought
  that this change will affect anyone.  If this causes problems,
  please `create an issue <https://github.com/newtdb/db/issues/new>`_.

  The change to persistent references was made in a backward-compatible
  way, but the backward compatibility support will be dropped in Newt
  DB version 1.

- Added a data-transformation option:

  transformer
    Callable to transform data records after they've been converted to
    JSON.

0.3.0 (2017-02-10)
------------------

- Added an API for following database changes.

- Exposed JSON conversion as an API that can be used to for other
  applications than updating the newt table, like updating external
  indexes.

- Created a JSON conversion object to support conversion customization.

- Added `zodburi
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/zodburi/en/latest/index.html>`_,
  making it easier to use Newt DB with applications like `Pyramid
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/>`_ that
  use zodburi.

0.2.2 (2017-02-08)
------------------

- Fixed a packaging bug.


0.2.1 (2017-02-06)
------------------

- Fixed: Packing wasn't handled correctly. Objects removed during
  packing weren't removed from the ``newt`` table.

0.2.0 (2017-01-30)
------------------

- Added PyPy support

- Fixed: ``datetime`` values with time zones weren't handled correctly.

0.1.2 (2017-01-26)
------------------

- Fixed a number of documentation errors.

  (Documentation wasn't tested, but now is, thankd to `manuel
  <http://pythonhosted.org/manuel/>`_.)

- Added some missing names to ``newt.db``.

0.1.1 (2017-01-24)
------------------

Fixed a small Python 2 bug that prevented import.

0.1.0 (2017-01-24)
------------------

Initial release
