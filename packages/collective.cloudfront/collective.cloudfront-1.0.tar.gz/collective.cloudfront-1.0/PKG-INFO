        AWS CloudFront support for plone.app.caching
        
        This add-on watches for Purge notifications from ``plone.app.caching`` and sends the corresponding invalidation requests to an instance of Amazon’s CloudFront.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Configurable in Site Setup (@@cloudfront-controlpanel)
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        You will need to create an access key in your AWS Console.
        
        Once you have the key’s ID and secret, you can provide them to your Plone site via Site Setup under “CloudFront Configuration”. You will also need to provide the ID for your CloudFront distribution.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.cloudfront by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.cloudfront
