Python library that helps you connect to Amazon's
`IVONA <https://www.ivona.com/>`__ Speech Cloud from within your Python
project. All you need to use it are the `access
keys <http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/introduction.html#Credentials>`__.

It currently only implements ``CreateSpeech`` and ``ListVoices``
endpoints, as they should cover the vast majority of use cases. Lexicons
endpoints may be added in the future.

If you're looking for out-of-the-box solution, you should probably use
`ivona-speak <https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak>`__ - it's a
script that uses this library and lets you use its functionality
directly from your shell.

Installation
------------

>From PyPI:

::

    $ pip install ivona_api

API
---

There's no proper documentation as of now, but the code is commented and
*should* be pretty straightforward to use.

That said - feel free to open a `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/Pythonity/python-ivona-api/issues/new>`__ if
anything is unclear.

Tests
-----

Package was tested with the help of ``py.test`` and ``tox`` on Python
2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 (see ``tox.ini``).

Code coverage is available at
`Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/Pythonity/python-ivona-api>`__.

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
and access keys before running ``tox`` inside the repository:

.. code:: shell

    $ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='...'
    $ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='...'
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox
