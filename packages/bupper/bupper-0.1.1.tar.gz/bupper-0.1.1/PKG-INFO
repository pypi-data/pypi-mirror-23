        Simple backup application which allows per-directory backup control by
        simply including a ``_BACKUP_THIS`` file.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Bupper is very simple: it will recurse through a given directory,
        looking for a special file indicating that it should be backedup
        (``_BACKUP_THIS``), and then it will put that directory into a
        ``.tar.gz`` archive, named after the directory and the current time, and
        ``scp`` it to a given location.
        
        This has few moving parts and works well for a simple household-backup
        solution, where "whitelisting" a few important directories in your home
        for backup via transfer to a local network host makes the most sense.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Assuming Python's ``pip`` is installed (for Debian-based systems, this
        can be installed with ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``), bupper can
        be installed directly from PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            pip install bupper
        
        Python versions 3.3+ (and 2.6+) are supported and tested against.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Think about how you will configure bupper. The main thing you will
           want to configure is the ``--remote`` flag, which should be remote
           host and path, or some sort of external storage, that would allow an
           SSH login:
        
           ::
        
               bupper \
               --source '/home/'\
               --remote 'backupuser@remote.host:/var/backups/bupper/'
        
        2. **Note:** that 'source' does not actually back EVERYTHING up in that
           directory. Instead, it will recursively look for directories that
           contain a certain filename (``_BACKUP_THIS``).
        
        3. Setup ``bupper`` with your chosen configuration to run on
           `cron <https://askubuntu.com/questions/2368/how-do-i-set-up-a-cron-job>`__
           at a regular time (such as daily).
        
        4. (Optional) Add cron jobs that clean up old backups -- this is up to
           you how you want to do this.
