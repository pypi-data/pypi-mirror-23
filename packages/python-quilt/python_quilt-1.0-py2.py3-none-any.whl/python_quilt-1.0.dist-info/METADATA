python-quilt is a python_ implementation of the well-known tool quilt_
to manage a series of patches.

It's intended to be used within a python application or framework but
also provides a console client interface called pquilt.

python-quilt requires the six_ package for python 2/3 compatibility. It
also requires patch_ and diff_ tools for creating and applying diffs.
