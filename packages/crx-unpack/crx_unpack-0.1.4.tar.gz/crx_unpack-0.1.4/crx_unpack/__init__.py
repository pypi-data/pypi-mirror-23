"""
The purpose of this module is to mimic how Google Chrome unpacks CRX files
as closely as possible. Involved in this is the need to remove the CRX headers
(see the structure details of CRXs on the :doc:`Home <index>` page), separate
the underlying ZIP file, extract the contents of the ZIP file, among other
things.

For end users, the only function you should need to call is :py:func:`unpack`,
which will handle each of the steps mentioned above.

    As part of the unpacking process, this function will create a duplicate of
    the CRX but with the headers removed. This is technically a temporary file
    and will not persist past a reboot of the machine. However, because this
    ZIP file may be of interest to users, it is not deleted after the unpacking
    process is complete. To discover the path to this file, you'll need to
    either (1) set the `zip_dir` parameter yourself, or (2) set the logging

    :param bool overwrite_if_exists: When extracting to a directory that already
        exists, unpack will normally fail. Setting this to True will delete
        the contents of the destination directory before unzipping.

        image file converted during the unpacking process.

        test feature to test the validity of the embedded zip file before

    :param bool convert_in_subprocess: Flag indicating if the job of converting
        the images in the CRX should be done in a subprocess rather than calling
        the function directly. Usually this SHOULD be set, since converting
        images can sometimes cause a segmentation fault, which kills the whole
