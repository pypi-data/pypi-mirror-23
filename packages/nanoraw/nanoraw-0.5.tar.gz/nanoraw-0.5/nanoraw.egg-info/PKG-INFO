Description: ## Summary
        This package provides tools for the analysis of raw nanopore sequencing data, including correction of basecalls and visualization.
        
        ## Full Documentation
        Full documentation available at [Read the Docs](https://nanoraw.readthedocs.io)
        
        ## Installation
        Install nanoraw without plotting dependencies (base genome_resquiggle algorithm and text outputs: wig and fasta)
        ```
        pip install nanoraw
        ```
        
        Install nanoraw with plotting dependencies (requires separate installation of R packages ggplot2 and cowplot)
        ```
        pip install nanoraw[plot]
        ```
        
        Install bleeding edge via github
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/marcus1487/nanoraw.git
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        nanoraw -h
        nanoraw [command] [options]
        ```
        
        #### Main Comand (Must be run before any other commands):
             genome_resquiggle             Re-annotate raw signal with genomic aignement of existing basecalls.
        
        #### Genome Anchored Plotting Commands:
             plot_max_coverage             Plot signal in regions with the maximum coverage.
             plot_genome_location          Plot signal at defined genomic locations.
             plot_motif_centered           Plot signal at regions centered on a specific motif.
             plot_max_difference           Plot signal where signal differs the most between two groups.
             plot_most_significant         Plot signal where signal differs the most significantly between two groups.
             plot_motif_with_stats         Plot signal from several regions and test statistics centered on a motif of interst.
        
        #### Sequencing Time Anchored Plotting Commands:
             plot_correction               Plot segmentation before and after correction.
             plot_multi_correction         Plot multiple raw signals anchored by genomic location.
        
        #### Other Plotting Commands:
             cluster_most_significant      Clustering traces at bases with significant differences.
             plot_kmer                     Plot signal quantiles acorss kmers.
        
        #### Auxiliary Commands:
             write_most_significant        Write sequence where signal differs the most significantly between two groups.
             write_wiggles                 Write wiggle files for nanopore signal values, coverage, and statistics.
