OpenStack docs.openstack.org Sphinx Theme
=========================================

Theme and extension support for Sphinx documentation that is published to
docs.openstack.org and developer.openstack.org.

Intended for use by OpenStack `projects governed by the Technical Committee`_.

.. _`projects governed by the Technical Committee`:

Using the Theme
===============

Prior to using this theme, ensure your project can use the OpenStack
brand by referring to the brand guidelines at
https://www.openstack.org/brand.

Update the requirements list for your project to
include ``openstackdocstheme`` (usually in test-requirements.txt).

If your project previously used the oslosphinx theme (without modifying
the header navigation), remove oslosphinx from your requirements list,
and then in your ``conf.py`` you can remove the import statement and
extension listing for oslosphinx.

Some of the settings below are included in the file generated by Sphinx when
you initialize a project, so they may already have values that need to be
changed.

Then modify your Sphinx settings in ``conf.py`` to include::

   html_theme = 'openstackdocs'

and to add ``'openstackdocstheme'`` to the list of extensions Sphinx
needs to initialize::

   extensions = [
       # ...
       'openstackdocstheme',
       # ...
   ]

Set the options to link to the git repository and bug tracker.

``repository_name``
    The prefix and repo name. For example,
    ``'openstack/python-glanceclient'``.

``bug_project``
    The launchpad project name. For example, ``python-glanceclient``.

``bug_tag``
   Launchpad bug tag. If unspecified, no tag is set.  The default is
   empty.

For example::

    # openstackdocstheme options
    repository_name = 'openstack/python-glanceclient'
    bug_project = 'python-glanceclient'
    bug_tag = ''

Enable the "last-updated" information by setting the format for the
timestamp::

   # Must set this variable to include year, month, day, hours, and minutes.
   html_last_updated_fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
