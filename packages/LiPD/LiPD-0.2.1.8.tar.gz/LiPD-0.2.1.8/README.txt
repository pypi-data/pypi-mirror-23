LiPD
====

Input/output and manipulation utilities for LiPD files in Matlab, R and
Python.

What is it?
-----------

LiPD is short for Linked PaleoData. LiPD is the data standard for
paleoclimatology and the exchange of data amongst paleoclimate experts.
This package will help you convert your existing database of
paleoclimate observations into LiPD files. Moreover, it contains tools
to analyze and manipulate LiPD data.

Installation
------------

LiPD is a package containing multiple modules. Install globally on your
system with:

::

    pip install LiPD

Python v3.4+ is required

Usage
-----

Using your preferred Python IDE or a Python console, you can import the
LiPD package using:

::

    import lipd

This import will trigger a prompt asking you to choose a source
directory containing files.

Now you can call any function in the LiPD package.

::

    lipd.loadLipds()

::

    lipd.excel()

::

    lipd.doi()

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

A Jupyter Notebook is an instructional tool to show examples of python
code and code output. We have created a set of Notebooks as guides to
getting familiar with LiPD and its functions. These Notebooks can be
found in the github repository as '.ipynb' files.

*Jupyter is not required to use the LiPD package.*

Requirements
------------
