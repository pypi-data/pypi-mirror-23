INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
----

LiPD needs a few things before it can work properly. The correct version of Python for running the package, PIP to make
the LiPD package installation simple, and the LiPD package itself. Follow these steps in order if you are not sure
you system meets the requirements.



PYTHON
=========

https://www.python.org/downloads/

LiPD has been developed and tested on Python 3.4.1. You're welcome to download this specific version from the python
archives, but the most current version of Python 3 that is greater than 3.4.1 should work as well. Use the link to
download Python and follow their instructions.



PIP
=========

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

PIP has recently started being included with newer versions of Python 3. That's good news! That means that this step
is even easier for you. You do not need to install PIP, but it is recommended that you upgrade it to the most recent
version.

On Linux and OS X, open the Terminal application and type:

    pip install -U pip

On Windows, open the Command Prompt application and type:

    python -m pip install -U pip



LIPD
=========

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LiPD

There are two ways to install LiPD. The fastest and easiest is through the "pip" command. If you have trouble, or
prefer to do a manual install, that is also an option.



Install via pip:

    1. Open your command line application and type:

            pip install LiPD

    That's it! LiPD is installed and you're done.



Manual install:

    * This guide assumes that the source code will be downloaded to your system's default "Downloads" folder.

    1. Download the source code:

        https://github.com/nickmckay/LiPD-utilities/archive/master.zip

    2. Unzip the source code file

    3. Open your command line application and navigate to the source folder:

        cd Downloads/LiPD-utilities-master/Python

    4. Run the setup file:

        python3 setup.py install

        * If you have permissions errors, you may need to run "sudo python3 setup.py install".
        * Some systems come pre-installed with Python 2.7 as the default. Using the "python" command will use
        Python 2.7, which we do not want. Therefore, it is important to use "python3".

    Done! The setup file will install everything you need and you're ready to start working. If the source code is
    not located in the Downloads folder and you need help using Terminal, use this link as a guide for step 3.
