        A simple CLI program to watch an html file and css for changes and reload the browser when a change is saved to either file.
        
        **Installation**
        
        Install from PyPI::

        **Usage**
        
        Just pass the html file you want to reload and watch as the first argument and the css file you want to watch as the second argument.
