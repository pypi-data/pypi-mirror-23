        Seashore provides a shell abstraction
        for easy automation of UNIX commands in Python.
        The primary interface to many common tools is the command line;
        for example, :code:`git`, :code:`apt-get`, and :code:`yum`.
        Even when there is an equivalent Python library --
        such as :code:`docker` and :code:`docker-py` --
        often a shell script needs to be quickly ported one-to-one.
        Seashore helps in these cases by being able to write a
        clean, simple, and testable Python API wrapper around
        these tools.
