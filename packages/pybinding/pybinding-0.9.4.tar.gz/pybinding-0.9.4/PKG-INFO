        v0.9.4 | 2017-07-13
        
        * Fixed issues with multi-orbital models: matrix onsite terms were not set correctly if all the
          elements on the main diagonal were zero ([#5](https://github.com/dean0x7d/pybinding/issues/5)),
          hopping terms were being applied asymmetrically for large multi-orbital systems
          ([#6](https://github.com/dean0x7d/pybinding/issues/6)). Thanks to
          [@oroszl (László Oroszlány)](https://github.com/oroszl) for reporting the issues.
        
        * Fixed KPM Hamiltonian scaling for models with all zeros on the main diagonal but asymmetric
          spectrum bounds (non-zero KPM scaling factor `b`).
        
        * Fixed compilation on certain Linux distributions
          ([#4](https://github.com/dean0x7d/pybinding/issues/4)). Thanks to
          [@nu11us (Will Eggleston)](https://github.com/nu11us) for reporting the issue.
        
        * Fixed compilation with Visual Studio 2017.
        
        * Improved support for plotting slices of multi-layer systems. See "Plotting Guide" > "Model
          structure" > "Slicing layers" in the documentation.
