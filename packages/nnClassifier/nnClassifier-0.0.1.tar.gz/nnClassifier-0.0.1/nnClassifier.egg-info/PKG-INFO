Description: # nnClassify
        Command line tool for classifying images
        
         Toxicology – the branch of science concerned with the nature,
         effects, and detection of poisons – has 
         traditionally relied on expensive mammalian studies.
         However, due to the large number of environmental
         toxins that need testing, less expensive, high 
         throughput alternatives are required. Planaria – a small 
         asexual flatworm – provide an inexpensive and scalable
         solution. The small size of planaria not only makes
         them inexpensive to maintain, but also easy to 
         image with a high-resolution camera. Researchers can
         run many test simultaneously, record the planarias
         reaction, and use computer vision techniques to 
         analyze the results in a cost-effect and timely manner.
         The results of some of these tests can be analyzed
         using traditional computer vision techniques;
         however, many tests involve classifying features of the
         planaria – such as their body shape or eyes – as
         normal or abnormal. Deep convolutional neural
         networks have achieved state of the art results on image
         classification tasks, but they require a large training
         set of images. Researchers do not have the time
         or resources to hand-label sufficient images for this
         technique to be effective. Using transfer-learning, we
         have developed a software platform for researchers to
         quickly classify images with near state-of-the-art
         performance and minimal training data.
