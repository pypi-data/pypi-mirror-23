        vHist is a class to simplify the display of different kind of histograms. Meant to be used in conjunction
        with the vImg class. By adding a single 3-tuple bool parameter (RGB) to indicate which channels are active 
        in the histogram, we can automatically calculate what type of histogram to show information for. Therefore,
        initialization and show functionality may be standardized.
        
        Content below is copyright Dr. Adrian Rosebrock from his excellent book Practical Python and OpenCV. A must 
        read if you intend to learn how to use OpenCV properly and in the most consumable fashion currently out there.
        I am hoping he doesn't mind me using it in the open here, but I suppose I should really put contacting him 
        and asking his explicit permission to use snippets like these in this library is ok with him. Then 
        the only hard part will be remembering to delete these couple of sentences.
        
        images   : This is the image that we want to compute a histogram for. Wrap it as a list: [myImage] . 
        channels : A list of indexes, where we specify the index of the channel we want to compute a histogram for. 
                   To compute a histogram of a grayscale image, the list would be [0] . To compute a histogram for all 
                   three red, green, and blue channels, the channels list would be [0, 1, 2] . 
        mask     : Remember learning about masks in Section 1.4.8? Well, here we can supply a mask. If a mask is 
                   provided, a histogram will be computed for masked pixels only. If we do not have a mask or do not 
                   want to apply one, we can just provide a value  of None . 
        histSize : This is the number of bins we want to use when computing a histogram. Again, this is a list, one 
                   for each channel we are computing a histogram for. The bin sizes do not all have to be the same. 
                   Here is an example of 32 bins for each channel: [32, 32, 32] . 
        ranges   : The range of possible pixel values. Normally, this is [0, 256] (this is not a typo — the ending 
                   range of the cv2.calcHist  function is non-inclusive so you’ll want to provide a value of 256 rather 
                   than 255) for each channel, but if you are using a color space other than RGB [such as HSV], 
                   the ranges might be different.)
