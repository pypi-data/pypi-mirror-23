In recent weeks both the U.S. and Somalia have stepped up their efforts against al-Shabab. Last month, President Donald Trump approved expanded operations against the militants, including more aggressive airstrikes. </p>                                                                                                                                                      <p> Also last month, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/somalia-s-new-army-chief-survives-car-bomb-kills-13-n744311">Somalia's new military chief survived a suicide car bomb attack</a> that killed 13 people, according to police. Al-Shabab, which claimed responsibility for the incident, is based in Somalia but has also said it was behind major attacks elsewhere in East Africa. The al-Qaeda-allied group was chased out of Mogadishu years ago but continues to fight the country's United Nations-backed government. It promotes the Wahhabi version of Islam and has imposed Sharia law in areas under its control. </p>                                                                                                                                                </div>               </div></body></html>
