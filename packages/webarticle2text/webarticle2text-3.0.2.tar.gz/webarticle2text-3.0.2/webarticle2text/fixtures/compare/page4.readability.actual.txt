Trump has vowed to stimulate the U.S. economy by boosting manufacturing jobs.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Washington and Riyadh are eager to improve relations strained under President Barack Obama in part because of his championing of a nuclear deal with Saudi foe Iran.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Lockheed Martin Co (<span id="symbol_LMT.N_0">LMT.N</span>) programs in the package include a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system with several batteries, the sources said. The THAAD system, like the one being made operational in South Korea, costs about $1 billion.    Also being negotiated is a C2BMC software system for battle command and control and communications as well as a package of satellite capabilities, both provided by Lockheed.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations, which also include previously reported contracts or items under discussion for years.    One such deal, an $11.5 billion package of four multi-mission surface combatant ships and accompanying services and spares, was approved by the State Department in 2015. Talks followed to hammer out capabilities, configuration and design for the complex warships but the deal has never gone to final contract.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>                                  <span class="article-divide first-article-divide"/><p>The next step for the ships is likely a letter of agreement between the two countries, the sources said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Versions of the ship used by the U.S. Navy, the Littoral Combat Ship, are built by Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker Lockheed Martin and Australia's Austal Ltd (<span id="symbol_ASB.AX_1">ASB.AX</span>). If a deal goes through, it would be the first sale of a new small surface warship to a foreign power in decades.    Any major foreign weapons sale is subject to oversight by Congress. Lawmakers must take into consideration a legal requirement that Israel must maintain its qualitative military edge over its neighbors.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Also, more than $1 billion worth of munitions including armor-piercing Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs made by Raytheon Co (<span id="symbol_RTN.N_2">RTN.N</span>) are in the package, the sources said.    The Obama administration suspended the planned sale because of concerns over the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen and civilian casualties.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>                                  <span class="article-divide second-article-divide"/><p>A U.S. administration official said the proposed Raytheon sale was still undergoing interagency review.    A Raytheon representative declined to comment on the sales.
