Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A nagios-like plugin to check if task jobs executed successfully
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        On the first run, it will ask you for basic configuration.
        - `basePath` is where each job will put his folder containing the logs
        
            (if a job log is in `/var/log/task/job/timestamp.log`, the basePath is `/var/log/task/`)
        - `endingString` is the string the script will look for too check if a job executed successfully, if the string is in the last line of file, then it's OK, CRITICAL otherwise. It will should be something like `;END\n`
        
        To change configuration go to the script install directory and open the config.ini file.
