Description: Introduction to ``OpenAnalysis``
        ================================
        
        In our daily life, we encounter many algorithms. Knowingly or
        Unknowingly, algorithms make our life easier. Analysis of algorithms is
        a special field of interest in Computer Science. Analysis evaluates the
        algorithm, and leads to invention of faster algorithms. Visualization
        leads to the better understanding of how algorithms work. The package
        ``OpenAnalysis`` is inteded as a tool for analyzing and visualizing
        algorithms.
        
        Types of supported algorithms
        -----------------------------
        
        The following types of algorithms are currently supported. We plan to
        support more kind of algorithms in the future.
        
        -  Comparision based Sorting Algorithms ( Analysis + Visualization )
        -  Comparision based Searching Algorithms ( Analysis )
        -  Comparision based Pattern Matching Algorithms ( Analysis )
        -  Data Structures and Related algorithms ( Visualization )
        -  Graph Algorithms based on Tree Growth techinique ( Visualizaiton )
        -  Graph Algorithms utilizing Matrix and Dynamic Programming (
           Visualization )
        
        Setting up ``OpenAnalysis``
        ---------------------------
        
        ``OpenAnalysis`` is only supported on Python versions which are greater
        than 3.5. Once you have suitable version of Python installed, you can
        simply obtain ``OpenAnalysis`` via ``pip`` (or ``pip3``, if you have
        multiple versions of Python installed)
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install OpenAnalysis
        
        If all things go well, you have working installation of
        ``OpenAnalysis``.
