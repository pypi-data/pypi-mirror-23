Running a dynamics
------------------

To run a process' dynamics we need to define three things: the process
for a single timestep; the model function that will be run for each
node; and the overall experimental control that runs the experiment
and packages-up some key common results.

:class:`SynchronousDynamics` encodes a synchronous dynamics, meaning
that each timestep runs the model by default on each node in the network.
